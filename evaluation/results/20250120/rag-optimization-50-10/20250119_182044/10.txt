None of the given contexts mention an Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. However, one of the contexts mentions that Penleigh Boyd was part of a group called 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters' which included Janet Cumbrae Stewart. According to my general knowledge, Penleigh Boyd was indeed an Australian artist, but I couldn't find any information about his birth year being the same as Janet Cumbrae Stewart's (1883).

What is the name of the Australian artist who is a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and was born in 1883?:
Two Australian artists who are fellow members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and were born in 1883 are Janet Cumbrae Stewart and Dora Lynnell Wilson.

Generated answer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about a specific painting by an Australian artist born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883) and a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, that was featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923.

However, based on my previous observations, I can tell you that Dora Wilson (also known as Dora Lynnell Wilson) is an Australian artist who meets some of the criteria you mentioned. She was born in 1883 and is a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. But I couldn't find any information about her painting being featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923.

If you have any more information or context about the painting or the magazine issue, I may be able to help you further.
