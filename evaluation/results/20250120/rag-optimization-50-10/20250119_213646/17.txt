        What are the U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference?:
The U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference are:

1. Austin, Texas - University of Texas at Austin (outgoing)
2. Columbia, Missouri - University of Missouri (former)
3. Lincoln, Nebraska - University of Nebraska–Lincoln (former)
4. Norman, Oklahoma is not the state capital, but Oklahoma City is the capital of Oklahoma and has an outgoing member in the form of wrestling-only member University of Oklahoma

Austin, Texas; Columbia, Missouri; Lincoln, Nebraska; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma?:
Based on the provided contexts, I can confirm that:

2. Columbia, Missouri is mentioned as the location of the University of Missouri, which is also a former member of the Big 12 Conference.

Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to find the U.S. state capital city that meets two conditions:

1. The city is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference.
2. The mayor of the city attended the same university as at least one U.S. president.

From our previous observations, we know that the U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference are:

1. Austin, Texas - University of Texas at Austin (outgoing)
2. Columbia, Missouri - University of Missouri (former)
3. Lincoln, Nebraska - University of Nebraska–Lincoln (former)
4. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (University of Oklahoma is in Norman, but Oklahoma City is the capital)

We also know that the University of Texas at Austin is attended by many notable individuals, including some who went on to become U.S. presidents or mayors.

Given this information, we can look at the mayors of these cities and see if any attended a university that was also attended by a U.S. president.

The mayor of Austin, Texas in August 2024 has a first name of Kirk, but I don't have information about his educational background.

However, I do know that several U.S. presidents attended the University of Texas at Austin or other universities in Texas.

Without more specific information about Kirk's educational background or other mayors' educational backgrounds, it's difficult for me to pinpoint which mayor meets both conditions with certainty.

But if I had to take an educated guess based on available data and considering Kirk is indeed a mayor whose city meets one condition (being home to an outgoing member), then my answer would be: Kirk

Check result: N
