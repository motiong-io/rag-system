Generated answer: As of my knowledge cutoff, the Dewey Decimal Classification for the Charlotte Bronte book "Jane Eyre" published in 1847 is 823.8. 

If we assume that the height of the Bronte Tower is 823.8 feet, we can compare it to the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024.

According to my knowledge, some of the tallest buildings in New York City include:

1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet
2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet
3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet
4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet
5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet

And so on...

The Bronte Tower at approximately 824 feet would likely rank outside of the top ten but possibly within the top twenty or thirty among the tallest buildings in New York City.

To give you a more precise ranking I would need more up-to-date information about all skyscrapers that are currently standing and have been completed as of August 2024.

However I can tell you that there are several notable skyscrapers with heights between eight hundred and nine hundred such as The Bank of America Tower (846 ft), The New York Times Building (814 ft) or Three Bryant Park also known as The former HRH building (838 ft).

Given these comparisons it seems reasonable to conclude that if a tower called "Bronte tower" existed at this height it might be somewhere around thirtieth place among all completed high-rise structures within NYC limits depending upon how one defines what constitutes an actual 'building'.
