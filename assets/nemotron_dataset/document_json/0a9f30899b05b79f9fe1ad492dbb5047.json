The focus is on a 20-something couple with unspecified learning difficulties, Olinka (Kate\u0159ina Hol\u00e1nov\u00e1) and Standa (Jan Buda\u0159), who are preparing to have sex for the first time. Standa has been receiving advice from his brother Jarda (Martin Pechl\u00e1t), while Olinka has been given tips and guidance by her friends, the women who live in her apartment block. Standa and Jarda travel to Brno from Brundal for the occasion.\n\nMeanwhile, in a nearby pub, depressed actor Mirek (Miroslav Donutil) is with psychologist Vlasta (Pavla Tomicov\u00e1), complaining about his life, and the two presently return to Vlasta's flat together where they have sex, and Vlasta counsels Mirek about the state of his marriage. In the same pub are Jaroslava (Ivana Uhl\u00ed\u0159ov\u00e1), a young woman who habitually attracts unpleasant men, and her current partner Richard (Marek Daniel), a pretentious and self-absorbed man who is tempted by sexual experimentation and submission. This couple return to Richard's flat in the same apartment block where Richard persuades an unwilling Jaroslava to spank him, alongside other requests. Also in the pub are life-long friends Honza (Pavel Li\u0161ka) and Pavel (Filip Rajmont). While Honza rambles drunkenly about his desire for various women, Pavel has an undeclared love for Honza.\n\nAt the house, Olinka is horrified to see her controlling mother return unexpectedly to the flat. Panicking, she administers rohypnol into her mother's coffee, and locks her unconscious in a storage cupboard. Standa arrives and they visit Olinka's friends so Standa can be vetted for their approval. Back down in Olinka's flat, Standa and Olinka share an awkward meal, and then proceed to the bedroom and are extremely nervous, but eventually Olinka manages to initiate sex. Despite Jarda's training, Standa is unable to put on the condom, so they do not use one. Meanwhile Jarda arrives at Olinka's friends' party upstairs to drink with them.\n\nMeanwhile, Mirek leaves Vlasta's house to go home, but on the way has a drunken argument with his wife on the phone, and ends up walking home to L\u00ed\u0161e\u0148 in a drunken depression. Honza and Pavel also head home to Pavel's house, and Pavel is perturbed when Honza kisses his cheek while he sleeps. After having sex, Olinka excitedly tells her friends what happened, but at the same time her mother wakes up and sees Standa dancing in his underwear through the keyhole. When Olinka returns to the flat, the two women argue, and Standa flees the flat in panic.\n\nPavel and Honza leave Pavel's place very early to deliver rohl\u00edk to L\u00ed\u0161e\u0148, but on the way Pavel takes his eyes off the road and hits Mirek, killing him. Comforting Pavel, Honza confides that his love is returned. Meanwhile, Olinka releases her mother from the pantry, but then locks her in again when Standa returns to her. A voice over confirms that Olinka is pregnant.\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n* Nuda v Brn\u011b at IMDb\n\n| * v * t * e Czech Lion for Best Film | |\n| --- | --- |\n| * *Big Beat* (1993\\) * *Thanks for Every New Morning* (1994\\) * *The Garden* (1995\\) * *Kolya* (1996\\) * *Buttoners* (1997\\) * *Sekal Has to Die* (1998\\) * *The Idiot Returns* (1999\\) * *Divided We Fall* (2000\\) * *Little Otik* (2001\\) * *Year of the Devil* (2002\\) * *Boredom in Brno* (2003\\) * *Up and Down* (2004\\) * *Something Like Happiness* (2005\\) * *I Served the King of England* (2006\\) * *Little Girl Blue* (2007\\) * *The Karamazov Brothers* (2008\\) * *Protector* (2009\\) * *Walking Too Fast* (2010\\) * *Poupata* (2011\\) * *In the Shadow* (2012\\) * *Burning Bush* (2013\\) * *The Way Out* (2014\\) * *The Snake Brothers* (2015\\) * *A Prominent Patient* (2016\\) * *Ice Mother* (2017\\) * *Winter Flies* (2018\\) * *The Painted Bird* (2019\\) * *Charlatan* (2020\\) * *Z\u00e1topek* (2021\\) * *Il Boemo* (2022\\) * *Brothers* (2023\\) | |\n\n* v\n* t\n* e\n\n* *Big Beat* (1993\\)\n* *Thanks for Every New Morning* (1994\\)\n* *The Garden* (1995\\)\n* *Kolya* (1996\\)\n* *Buttoners* (1997\\)\n* *Sekal Has to Die* (1998\\)\n* *The Idiot Returns* (1999\\)\n* *Divided We Fall* (2000\\)\n* *Little Otik* (2001\\)\n* *Year of the Devil* (2002\\)\n* *Boredom in Brno* (2003\\)\n* *Up and Down* (2004\\)\n* *Something Like Happiness* (2005\\)\n* *I Served the King of England* (2006\\)\n* *Little Girl Blue* (2007\\)\n* *The Karamazov Brothers* (2008\\)\n* *Protector* (2009\\)\n* *Walking Too Fast* (2010\\)\n* *Poupata* (2011\\)\n* *In the Shadow* (2012\\)\n* *Burning Bush* (2013\\)\n* *The Way Out* (2014\\)\n* *The Snake Brothers* (2015\\)\n* *A Prominent Patient* (2016\\)\n* *Ice Mother* (2017\\)\n* *Winter Flies* (2018\\)\n* *The Painted Bird* (2019\\)\n* *Charlatan* (2020\\)\n* *Z\u00e1topek* (2021\\)\n* *Il Boemo* (2022\\)\n* *Brothers* (2023\\)\n\n| Authority control databases: National | * Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- |\n\n* Czech Republic", "chunks": [{"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Boredom_in_Brno_0", "original_index": 0, "content": "|  | This article **relies largely or entirely on a single source**.
