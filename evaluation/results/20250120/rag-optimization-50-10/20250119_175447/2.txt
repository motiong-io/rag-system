Generated answer: To determine how many years earlier Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol, we need to consider the location of the US capitol and the history of Groundhog Day predictions.

The US capitol is located in Washington, D.C., which is not a state but a federal district. Since Punxsutawney Phil is located in Pennsylvania, we need to find out if there were any Groundhog Day predictions made in the vicinity of Washington, D.C.

However, according to the provided context, there is no information about Groundhog Day predictions being made in Washington, D.C. The tradition of Groundhog Day predictions is mentioned to have started in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887.

But, if we assume that Punxsutawney Phil were to make a prediction in the same federal district as the US capitol (Washington, D.C.), and considering that the first recorded prediction by Phil was in 1886 (or 1887, when the event formally began), we would need to look for any instances of Groundhog Day celebrations or predictions being made in Washington, D.C. prior to 1886.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific year when Groundhog Day predictions started being made in Washington, D.C. But we can look at the general history of Groundhog Day. 

Groundhog Day has its roots in a Germanic tradition, and it was brought to North America by German immigrants. The first recorded Groundhog Day celebration in the United States was in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. However, it is likely that similar celebrations were held in other parts of the country, including areas with German settlements, prior to 1887.

If we consider the area around Washington, D.C., there were German settlements in the region, particularly in Maryland and Pennsylvania. However, without specific information on when Groundhog Day predictions started being made in Washington, D.C., it's difficult to determine exactly how many years earlier Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive to have made a prediction in the same state (or federal district) as the US capitol.

But since there's no record of any groundhog making predictions before 1887 in the US and considering Phil has been making predictions since 1886 (or 1887), it can be said that for Phil to have made a prediction in Washington D.C., he would have to be alive at least as early as the first German settlers arrived in the Washington D.C. area, which would likely be in the 18th century (1700s) when German immigrants started settling in the region. 

So approximately, Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive around 100-150 years earlier than his current "birth year" or the year he is considered to have started making predictions (1886 or 1887) to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same federal district as the US capitol.
