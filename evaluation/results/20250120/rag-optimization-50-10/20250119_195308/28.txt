If you subtract the year that William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born from the year Obama was first sworn in as President to the United States and multiply it by 18, what number would you get?:
To solve this problem, we need to know the year that William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born and the year Obama was first sworn in as President.

According to the text, William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born in 1963. 

Barack Obama was first sworn in as President on January 20, 2009.

Now, let's subtract the birth year from the year Obama was sworn in: 
2009 - 1963 = 46

Then, multiply by 18: 
46 * 18 = 828

So, the result is 828.


        


Generated answer: To solve this problem, we need to know the year that William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born and the year Obama was first sworn in as President, as well as the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024.

According to the text, William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born in 1963. 

Barack Obama was first sworn in as President on January 20, 2009.

Now, let's subtract the birth year from the year Obama was sworn in: 
2009 - 1963 = 46

As for the number of administrative regions in France, I don't have that information directly. However, I can tell you that as of my knowledge cutoff, France had 18 administrative regions (including Corsica). Please note that this information may have changed since my knowledge cutoff date.

Assuming there are indeed still around 18 regions or using a hypothetical number close to it for calculation purposes (since I do not have real-time data), if we use a figure close to this for our calculation:

Then, multiply by this assumed or given number: 
46 * (number of administrative regions)

If we were to use a figure like 18:
46 * 18 = 828

However, without knowing if there were changes after my knowledge cutoff date regarding French administrative divisions and their exact count on January 1, 2024, it is essential to verify if any adjustments occurred before providing an accurate answer based on up-to-date numbers.

Check result: Y
