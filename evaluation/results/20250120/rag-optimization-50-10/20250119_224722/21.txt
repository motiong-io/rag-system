Another context mentions the assassination of President Lincoln and the death of Princess Diana in a car crash, but neither of these cases involve a pageant winner being murdered by a stalker.

Generated answer: Since there is no information about a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker, I couldn't find any specific year for that event. However, I do know that Małgorzata Rożniecka won the title of Miss International in 2001.

If you're looking for information about a specific pageant winner who was murdered, I found that JonBenet Ramsey, a beauty pageant participant, was murdered in 1996. However, please note that the context doesn't explicitly state she was murdered by a stalker.

Assuming JonBenet Ramsey is the pageant winner you're referring to, the difference in title years would be 2001 (Małgorzata Rożniecka's win) - 1996 (JonBenet Ramsey's murder) = 5 years.

Check result: N
