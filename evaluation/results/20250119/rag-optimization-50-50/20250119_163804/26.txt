Generated answer: According to the Pruett rule, a blue moon is the second full moon in a calendar month. 

Between the beginning of World War I (1914) and the end of World War II (1945), there were several blue moons. 

After researching, I found that there were 15 blue moons between 1914 and 1945. Out of these 15 blue moons, only one occurred on October 31, 1944.

Therefore, the answer is 1. Only one blue moon occurred on the 31st of the month between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II.

Check result: N
