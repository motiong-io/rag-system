Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps. 

First, we need to identify the magazine that serialized the manga series "Raw Hero". According to our knowledge, the manga series "Raw Hero" was serialized in Kodansha's "Evening" magazine.

Next, we need to find out the publishing company of the magazine "Evening", which is Kodansha.

Then, we need to identify the founder of Kodansha, which is Seiji Noma.

After that, we need to determine the birth year of Seiji Noma, which is 1878.

We also need to find out the year the magazine "Evening" ended publication, which is 2023.

Finally, to calculate Seiji Noma's age in 2023, we subtract his birth year from 2023: 2023 - 1878 = 145. However, since Seiji Noma passed away in 1938, he would not have been alive in 2023. If he had been alive, he would have been 145 years old.

So, the founder of the publishing company of the magazine that serialized the manga series Raw Hero would have been 145 years old in the year the magazine ended publication if he were still alive.
