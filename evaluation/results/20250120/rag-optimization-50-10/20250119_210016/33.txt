Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. Identify the publishing company of the magazine that serialized "Raw Hero", which is Kodansha.
2. Identify the founder of Kodansha, which is Seiji Noma.
3. Determine the year the magazine "Evening" ended publication, which is 2023.
4. Calculate the age of Seiji Noma in 2023.

Seiji Noma was born in 1878 and passed away in 1938. 

If we calculate his age in 2023, assuming he was still alive:
2023 - 1878 = 145 years old.

So, the founder of the publishing company of the magazine that serialized the manga series "Raw Hero" would have been 145 years old in the year the magazine ended publication, if he were still alive.
