How many people had walked on the moon as of 1970?:
As of 1970, only the Apollo 11 mission had successfully landed humans on the Moon. This mission occurred in July 1969, and two people walked on the Moon: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

However, by the end of 1970, there was one more mission that landed humans on the Moon: Apollo 14 was not it, but it was not launched until 1971. 

The second mission to land humans on the Moon was actually Apollo 12, which launched in November 1969. Two people walked on the Moon during this mission: Pete Conrad and Alan Bean.

Therefore, as of 1970, a total of four people had walked on the Moon: 

1. Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11)
2. Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11)
3. Pete Conrad (Apollo 12)
4. Alan Bean (Apollo 12)

Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps.

First, we need to identify the General Motors vehicle named after the largest ward in Monaco. According to our knowledge, the largest ward in Monaco is Monte Carlo, and the vehicle named after it is the Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

Next, we need to determine the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo was first introduced in 1970 as a 1970 model.

Finally, we need to find out how many people had walked on the moon as of the 1970 model year. Since the 1970 model year refers to cars produced for 1970, and considering that these cars would have been available in late 1969 or early 1970, we look at the moon landings that occurred up to that point.

As of 1970, two missions had successfully landed humans on the Moon: Apollo 11 (in July 1969) and Apollo 12 (in November 1969). Therefore, as of the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo (1970), a total of four people had walked on the Moon:

1. Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11)
2. Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11)
3. Pete Conrad (Apollo 12)
4. Alan Bean (Apollo 12)

So, as of the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, four people had walked on the moon.
