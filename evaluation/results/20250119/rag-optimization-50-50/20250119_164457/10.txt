Generated answer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about a specific painting by an Australian artist born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883) and featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923. However, I can tell you that Dora Wilson, a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and born in 1883, might be the artist you are looking for. But I don't have any information about her painting being featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923 or the name of that specific painting.
