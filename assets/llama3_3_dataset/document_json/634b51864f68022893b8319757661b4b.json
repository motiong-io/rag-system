Gifu Prefecture borders Toyama Prefecture to the north; Ishikawa Prefecture to the northwest, Fukui Prefecture and Shiga Prefecture to the west, Mie Prefecture to the southwest, Aichi Prefecture to the south, and Nagano Prefecture to the east.\n\nGifu is the capital and largest city of Gifu Prefecture, with other major cities including \u014cgaki, Kakamigahara, and Tajimi.:\u200a246\n\nGifu Prefecture is located in the center of Japan, one of only eight landlocked prefectures, and features the country's center of population. Gifu Prefecture has served as the historic crossroads of Japan with routes connecting the east to the west, including the Nakasend\u014d, one of the Five Routes of the Edo period. Gifu Prefecture was a long-term residence of Oda Nobunaga and Sait\u014d D\u014dsan, two influential figures of Japanese history in the Sengoku period, spawning the popular phrase \"control Gifu and you control Japan\" in the late Medieval era. Gifu Prefecture is known for its traditional *Washi* paper industry, including Gifu lanterns and Gifu umbrellas, and as a center for the Japanese swordsmithing and cutlery industries. Gifu Prefecture is home to Gifu Castle, the 1,300-year-old tradition of cormorant fishing on the Nagara River, and the site of the Battle of Sekigahara.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe land area that makes up modern-day Gifu became part of the Yamato Court around the middle of the fourth century. Because it is in the middle of the island of Honshu, it has been the site of many decisive battles throughout Japan's history, the oldest major one being the Jinshin War in 672, which led to the establishment of Emperor Tenmu as the 40th emperor of Japan.\n\nThe area of Gifu Prefecture consists of the old provinces of Hida and Mino, as well as smaller parts of Echizen and Shinano. The name of the prefecture derives from its capital city, Gifu, which was named by Oda Nobunaga during his campaign to unify all of Japan in 1567\\. The first character used comes from Qishan (**\u5c90**\u5c71), a legendary mountain from which most of China was unified, whereas the second character comes from Qufu (\u66f2**\u961c**), the birthplace of Confucius. Nobunaga chose those characters because he wanted to unify all of Japan and he wanted to be viewed as a great mind.\n\nHistorically, the prefecture served as the center of swordmaking for the whole of Japan, with Seki being known for making the best swords in Japan. More recently, its strengths have been in fashion (primarily in the city of Gifu) and aerospace engineering (Kakamigahara).\n\nOn October 28, 1891, the present-day city of Motosu was the epicenter for the Mino\u2013Owari earthquake, the second largest earthquake to ever hit Japan. The earthquake, estimated at 8\\.0 (surface-wave magnitude), left a fault scarp that can still be seen today.\n\nGeography\n---------\n\nOne of the few landlocked prefectures in Japan, Gifu shares borders with seven other prefectures: Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Shiga, Mie, Aichi, and Nagano. Japan's postal codes all start with a three-digit number, ranging from 001 to 999\\. Part of Gifu has the 500 prefix, reflecting its location in the center of Japan.\nThe center of Japanese population is currently located in Seki City, Gifu Prefecture. The center of population is a hypothetical point at which a country is perfectly balanced assuming each person has a uniform weight. The spot was calculated using the 2005 census.\n\nAs of 31 March 2019,\\[update] 18 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Hakusan and Ch\u016bbu-Sangaku National Parks, Hida-Kisogawa and Ibi-Sekigahara-Y\u014dr\u014d Quasi-National Parks, and fifteen Prefectural Natural Parks.\n\n### Regions\n\nGifu has five unofficial regions, which allows local municipalities to work together to promote the surrounding area. The five regions are Sein\u014d, Gifu, Ch\u016bn\u014d, T\u014dn\u014d and Hida. The borders of the regions are loosely defined, but they are usually delineated among major cities.\n\n### Topography\n\nThe northern Hida region is dominated by tall mountains, including parts of the Japanese Alps. The southern Mino region is mostly parts of the fertile N\u014dbi Plain, a vast plains area with arable soil. Most of the prefecture's population lives in the southern part of the prefecture, near the designated city of Nagoya.\n\nThe mountainous Hida region contains the Hida Mountains, which are referred to as the \"Northern Alps\" in Japan. The Ry\u014dhaku Mountains are also in the Hida region. Other major ranges include the Ibuki Mountains and the Y\u014dr\u014d Mountains.\n\nMuch of the Mino region is made up of the alluvial plain of the Kiso Three Rivers, which are the Kiso River, Nagara River and Ibi River. The sources of Kiso river is in Nagano prefecture, and those of the others are in Gifu prefecture. They eventually run through Aichi and Mie prefectures before emptying into Ise Bay. Other major rivers in the prefecture include the Miya, Takahara, Sh\u014d, Toki (Sh\u014dnai), Yahagi, and Itoshiro rivers.\n\n### Climate\n\nGifu's climate varies from humid subtropical climate in the south, eventually making the transition to humid continental climate in the north.\n\nBecause the Mino region is surrounded by low mountains, the temperature fluctuates through the year, from hot summers to cold winters. The eastern city of Tajimi, for example, often records the hottest temperature in Japan each year and is considered to be the hottest city within Honshu boasting an average daytime high of 34\\.1 \u00b0C (93\\.4 \u00b0F) during the peak of summer. On August 16, 2007, Tajimi set the record for the hottest day recorded in Japan's history\u201440\\.9 \u00b0C (105\\.6 \u00b0F). Summers are hotter, as the landlocked area becomes a heat island, and the temperature rises even further when hot, dry foehn winds blow over the Ibuki Mountains from the Kansai region. The Hida region, with its higher elevation and northerly latitude, is significantly cooler than the Mino region, although there are sometimes extremely hot days there too. The Hida region is more famous for its harsh winters, bringing extremely heavy snowfall, especially in the northwestern areas. Gifu boasts a high amount of skiing locations. Sh\u014dkawa-ch\u014d, part of the city of Takayama, is up in the mountains, and its location has led it to be called the coldest inhabited place on Honsh\u016b.\n\n| **Gifu City (Mino Region)**    |

sector including aerospace and automotive, with industrial complexes extending from the Nagoya area. A wealth of small component manufacturing is also found, such as precision machines, dye and mold making, and plastic forming.\n\n### Traditional industries\n\nGifu is famous for cormorant fishing, which has a history of over 1,300 years. Agriculture is also a major industry because of Gifu's vast, arable plains. The forests in the north provide materials for woodworking and for the viewing boats used in cormorant fishing.\n\nThe Mino region has long been known for its high-quality paper called *Mino washi*, which is stronger and thinner than most other papers in Japan, and was used by the Japanese military during World War II. Other paper-based products include Gifu Lanterns and Gifu Umbrellas, made in the prefectural capital of Gifu. Other traditional goods include *mino-yaki* pottery in Tajimi, Toki, and Mizunami, cutlery in Seki, and lacquerware in Takayama. Sake is often brewed with clear water from the rivers.\n\n### Modern industries\n\nKakamigahara has a large role in the prefecture's modern industries. It boasts large aerospace facilities of both Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, as well as many metalworking and manufacturing companies.\n\nInformation technology (IT) is gaining a foothold in the prefecture with both Softopia Japan in \u014cgaki and VR Techno Japan (part of Techno Plaza) in Kakamigahara. The capital city of Gifu, located between \u014cgaki and Kakamigahara, is also working to strengthen its IT fields, too.\n\n### Tourism\n\nGifu has many popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to all parts of the prefecture. The most popular places are Gifu, Gero, Shirakawa and Takayama. Gero is known for its relaxing hot springs, which attract visitors throughout the year. Shirakawa's historic villages are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Takayama is famous for retaining its original appearance and is often referred to as *Little Kyoto*.\n\nIn addition to international tourists, Gifu also plays host to many international events. The World Event and Convention Complex Gifu is available for many types of events. Other areas of Gifu, too, bring international events. The World Rowing Championships were held in the city of Kaizu in 2005\\. The FIS Snowboard World Cup was held in the city of Gujo in 2008\\. The APEC Japan 2010 SME Ministerial Meetings were held in Gifu City.\n\n### Science\n\nThe Kamioka area of the city of Hida is home to the Kamioka Observatory underground laboratory. Located 1,000 m (3,281 ft) underground in Kamioka Mining and Smelting Co.'s Mozumi Mine, the Super-Kamiokande experiment searches for neutrinos from the high atmosphere, the sun and supernovae, while the KamLAND experiment searches for antineutrinos from regional nuclear reactors. The Super-Kamiokande consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank that is 41\\.4 m (136 ft) tall and 39\\.3 m (129 ft) in diameter holding 50,000 tons of ultra-pure water. Some of the 11,146 photomultiplier tubes are on display at the Miraikan in Tokyo. The same facility also hosts the CLIO prototype and KAGRA gravitational wave detector.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\nThe prefecture's population was 2,101,969, as of 1 September 2007,\\[update] with approximately 1\\.8 million people in the cities and the rest in towns and villages. The percentage of male and female residents is 48\\.4% and 51\\.6%, respectively. 14\\.4% of the population is no more than 14 years old, with 22\\.1% of the population being at least 65 years old.\n\nAccording to Japan's census, the country's center of population is located in Gifu Prefecture. In 2000, it was located in the former town of Mugi, which has since merged with Seki. In the most recent census in 2005, the center of population has moved slightly more to the east but is still located within Gifu.\n\nEducation\n---------\n\n* Asahi University\n* Chubu Gakuin University\n* Chukyo Gakuin University\n* Gifu City Women's College\n* Gifu College of Nursing\n* Gifu Keizai University\n* Gifu Pharmaceutical University\n* Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University\n* Gifu University\n* Gifu University of Medical Science\n* Gifu Women's University\n* Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences\n* Tokai Gakuin University\n\nTransportation\n--------------\n\n### Rail\n\n* Akechi Railway\n* JR Central\n\t+ Chuo Line\n\t+ Taita Line\n\t+ Takayama Line\n\t+ Tokaido Line\n\t+ Tokaido Shinkansen \u2013 Gifu-Hashima Station\n* Meitetsu\n\t+ Hashima Line\n\t+ Hiromi Line\n\t+ Inuyama Line\n\t+ Kakamigahara Line\n\t+ Nagoya Line\n\t+ Takehana Line\n* Nagaragawa Railway\n* Tarumi Railway\n* Yoro Railway\n\n* Chuo Line\n* Taita Line\n* Takayama Line\n* Tokaido Line\n* Tokaido Shinkansen \u2013 Gifu-Hashima Station\n\n* Hashima Line\n* Hiromi Line\n* Inuyama Line\n* Kakamigahara Line\n* Nagoya Line\n* Takehana Line\n\n### Road\n\n* Chubu Jukan Expressway\n* Chuo Expressway\n* Hakusan Forest Road\n* Meishin Expressway\n* Mount Ibuki Toll Road\n* Nagaragawa Riversideway\n* Tokai Hokuriku Expressway\n* Tokai Loop Expressway\n\n* Route 19\n* Route 21\n* Route 22\n* Route 41\n* Route 156\n* Route 157\n* Route 158\n* Route 248\n* Route 256\n* Route 257\n* Route 258\n* Route 303\n* Route 360\n* Route 361\n* Route 363\n* Route 365\n* Route 417\n* Route 418\n* Route 419\n* Route 471\n* Route 472\n* Route 475\n\nPrefectural symbols\n-------------------\n\nGifu's symbol comes from the first character *gi* (\u5c90) of its Japanese name, written in a stylized script, surrounded by a circle, which represents the peace and harmony of the prefectural citizen. It was chosen by contest in 1932\\.\n\nThe prefectural logo (*see right*) expands from the red dot into the center to the outer two lines and, finally, the yellow plain. This symbol was chosen in 1991 for the development and expansion of the prefecture.\n\nThe prefecture also has two plants (the milk vetch (renge) and the Japanese yew) and two animals (the snow grouse and the ayu) as symbols. The milk vetch was chosen in 1954, because the prefecture is well known for its abundance of blooming milk vetch each spring. The yew was chosen in 1966, because it is the tree used to make ornamental scepters for the emperor, many of which came from the Hida district. The snow grouse was chosen in 1961, as the birds live up in the Japanese alps and is a nationally protected species. Ayu were chosen in 1989, because the fish is found in many prefectural rivers and is prized for its sweet taste.\n\nNotable people\n--------------\n\n* Chie Aoki, sculptor\n* Junji Ito, manga artist\n* Tsuyoshi Makino, author and social activist\n* Rie Matsubara, rhythmic gymnast\n* Kaiu Shirai, manga artist\n* Chiune Sugihara, diplomat\n* Teiji Takagi, mathematician", "chunks": [{"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Gifu_Prefecture_0", "original_index": 0, "content": "| Gifu Prefecture \u5c90\u961c\u770c | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prefecture | |\n| Japanese transcription(s) | |\n| \u2022 Japanese | \u5c90\u961c\u770c |\n| \u2022 R\u014dmaji | *Gifu-ken* |\n| Cormorant fishing on the Nagara RiverMagome-jukuSpring Festival in TakayamaShirakawa-goHida Minzoku Mura Folk VillageA monument in Battle of SekigaharaUsuzumi cherry-blossom in MotosuMount Ibuki and Kiso River | |\n| FlagSymbol | |\n| Anthem: Gifu kenmin no uta | |\n|  | |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Region | Ch\u016bbu (T\u014dkai) |\n| Island | Honshu |\n| Capital | Gifu |\n| Subdivisions | Districts: 9, Municipalities: 42 |\n| Government | |\n| \u2022 Governor | Hajime Furuta |\n| Area | |\n| \u2022 Total | 10,621\\.29 km2 (4,100\\.90 sq mi) |\n| \u2022 Rank | 7th |\n| Population (June 1, 2019\\) | |\n| \u2022 Total | 1,991,390 |\n| \u2022 Rank | 17th |\n| \u2022 Density | 190/km2 (490/sq mi) |\n| GDP | |\n| \u2022 Total | JP\u00a57,937 billionUS$72\\.8 billion (2019\\) |\n| ISO 3166 code | JP-21 |\n| Website | www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/English |\n|  | |\n| Symbols of Japan | |\n|  | |\n| Bird | Rock ptarmigan(*Lagopus muta*) |", "contextualized_text": "Introduction to Gifu Prefecture's general information and statistics."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Gifu_Prefecture_1", "original_index": 1, "content": "|  | |\n| Symbols of Japan | |\n|  | |\n| Bird | Rock ptarmigan(*Lagopus muta*) |\n| Fish | Ayu(*Plecoglossus altivelis*) |\n| Flower | Chinese milk vetch(*Astragalus sinicus*) |\n| Tree | Japanese yew(*Taxus cuspidata*) |\n|  | |", "contextualized_text": "This chunk is part of the section describing Gifu Prefecture's symbols, located after the prefecture's overview and before the history section."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Gifu_Prefecture_2", "original_index": 2, "content": "**Gifu Prefecture** (\u5c90\u961c\u770c, *Gifu-ken*) is a prefecture of Japan located in the Ch\u016bbu region of Honshu.:\u200a246:\u200a126 Gifu Prefecture has a population of 1,991,390 (as of 1 June 2019\\[update]) and has a geographic area of 10,621 square kilometres (4,101 sq mi).

The name of the prefecture derives from its capital city, Gifu, which was named by Oda Nobunaga during his campaign to unify all of Japan in 1567\\. The first character used comes from Qishan (**\u5c90**\u5c71), a legendary mountain from which most of China was unified, whereas the second character comes from Qufu (\u66f2**\u961c**), the birthplace of Confucius.

The milk vetch was chosen in 1954, because the prefecture is well known for its abundance of blooming milk vetch each spring. The yew was chosen in 1966, because it is the tree used to make ornamental scepters for the emperor, many of which came from the Hida district. The snow grouse was chosen in 1961, as the birds live up in the Japanese alps and is a nationally protected species. Ayu were chosen in 1989, because the fish is found in many prefectural rivers and is prized for its sweet taste.\n\nNotable people\n--------------\n\n* Chie Aoki, sculptor\n* Junji Ito, manga artist\n* Tsuyoshi Makino, author and social activist\n* Rie Matsubara, rhythmic gymnast\n* Kaiu Shirai, manga artist\n* Chiune Sugihara, diplomat\n* Teiji Takagi, mathematician", "contextualized_text": "Prefectural symbols and notable individuals of Gifu Prefecture in Japan."}]}
