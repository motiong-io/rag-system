        obersevations:
        Who is the Pope born Pietro Barbo?:
The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He was born on February 23, 1417, in Venice, and he served as the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from August 30, 1464, until his death on July 26, 1471.

What long-running war did Pope Paul II end two years after his papacy began?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order. Pope Paul II helped to negotiate the Second Peace of Thorn, which was signed on October 10, 1466, two years after his papacy began in 1464.

What famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry, took place 400 years earlier than the end of the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order ended in 1466. 

400 years earlier than that would be 1266. The famous conflict that took place around that time and was immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry is the Norman Conquest of England, which occurred in 1066, not 1266. However, it is indeed a conflict that was immortalized in tapestry.

It's worth noting that there might be other conflicts from around 1266 that could fit this description as well, but given the specific mention of being "immortalized in tapestry," it seems likely you are referring to a famous historical event like this one.


        


Generated answer: The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He ended the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order two years after his papacy began. 

The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466. If we go back 400 years from that date, we get to around 1266. However, a famous conflict immortalized in tapestry that took place around that time period is actually the Norman Conquest of England, which occurred in 1066, about 60 years before 1266 but still a significant event immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry.

So while not exactly matching the "400 years earlier" timeframe perfectly due to historical records and events alignment, it's reasonable to consider this as a possible answer given its fame and representation in tapestry form.
