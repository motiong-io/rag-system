        Which U.S. president won Alaska?:
Alaska was purchased from Russia by the United States in 1867, during the presidency of Andrew Johnson. The purchase was negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, and it was finalized on March 30, 1867. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate on April 9, 1867, and Alaska was officially transferred to the United States on October 18, 1867.

So, to answer your question, it was Andrew Johnson who was the U.S. president when Alaska was purchased from Russia, but it was actually William H. Seward who played a key role in negotiating the purchase.

Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps.

First, we need to identify the U.S. president who won Alaska. According to our knowledge, Alaska was purchased from Russia during the presidency of Andrew Johnson.

Next, we need to find the U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael. Our knowledge indicates that this president is Gerald R. Ford.

Now, we have two different presidents: Andrew Johnson and Gerald R. Ford. Since the question asks for a single president who meets all three conditions, we need to check if either of these presidents meets all the conditions.

Andrew Johnson was the president when Alaska was purchased, but we don't have information about him graduating from Yale University or having a son named Michael.

Gerald R. Ford, on the other hand, graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael, but he was not the president when Alaska was purchased.

As it turns out, there is no single U.S. president who meets all three conditions. However, since the question asks for the middle name of the U.S. president who meets these conditions, and given that Andrew Johnson did not have a middle name, and Gerald R. Ford's full name is Gerald Rudolph Ford, we can conclude that there is no single president who meets all the conditions, but if we had to choose based on the available information, Gerald R. Ford's middle name is "Rudolph".

Check result: N
