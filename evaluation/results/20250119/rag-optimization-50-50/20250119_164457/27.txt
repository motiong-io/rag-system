        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947?:
The text does not specifically mention the numbering system used by Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947. However, it does mention that in the early days of squad numbers, they were assigned based on field position. 

For example, in a 1928 match at Stamford Bridge, the numbering system was as follows:
1. Goalkeeper
2. Right full back
3. Left full back
4. Right half back
5. Centre half back
6. Left half back
7. Outside right
8. Inside right
9. Centre forward
10. Inside left
11. Outside left

It also mentions that The Football League made squad numbers compulsory for the 1999-2000 season and that prior to this, some teams used traditional 1-11 numbering while others used persistent squad numbers.

However, during Tommy Lawton's time at Chelsea from 1945 to 1947, it is likely that they used a traditional numbering system or an early form of persistent squad numbers but there isn't enough information provided in the text to confirm this with certainty for Chelsea FC specifically during those years.

In general though, according to another part of the text: 
"In a traditional 4–4–2 system in the UK, the squad numbers 1–11 would usually have been:
- Squad number traditions and player number assignments in association football."

What position did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947?:
According to the text, Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward.


        


Generated answer: Based on the traditional numbering system used in the early days of football, where squad numbers were assigned based on field position, Tommy Lawton would likely have worn the number 9 jersey while playing as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947. This is because, according to the traditional numbering system mentioned earlier:

* 1. Goalkeeper
* 2. Right full back
* 3. Left full back
* 4. Right half back
* 5. Centre half back
* 6. Left half back
* 7. Outside right
* 8. Inside right
* **9. Centre forward**
* 10. Inside left
* 11. Outside left

So, it's likely that Tommy Lawton would have worn the number **9** jersey during his time at Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947 as a centre-forward player
