Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps. 

First, we need to identify the longest river in British Columbia that only flows within the province and does not enter any other province or territory. According to our knowledge, this river is the Fraser River.

Next, we need to find out who the Fraser River is named after. The Fraser River is named after Simon Fraser.

Now, we need to determine how old Harvard University was when Simon Fraser was born. We know that Harvard University was founded in 1636, and Simon Fraser was born in 1776. To find the age of Harvard University when Simon Fraser was born, we subtract the founding year from the birth year.

1776 - 1636 = 140
