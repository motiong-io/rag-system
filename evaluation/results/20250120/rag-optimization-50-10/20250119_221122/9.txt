        Who is the Pope born Pietro Barbo?:
The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He was born on February 23, 1417, in Venice, and he served as the Pope from August 30, 1464, until his death on July 26, 1471.

What long-running war did Pope Paul II end two years after his papacy began?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order. Pope Paul II helped to negotiate the Second Peace of Thorn, which was signed on October 10, 1466, ending the war. This occurred about two years after his papacy began in 1464.

What famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry, took place 400 years earlier than the end of the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order ended in 1466. 

400 years earlier than that would be 1266. 

The famous conflict that took place around that time and was immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry was the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, not 1266. However, another conflict that took place in 1266 and is not as widely known to be immortalized in tapestry is the Second Barons' War.


        


Generated answer: The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He ended the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order two years after his papacy began. 

The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466. 400 years earlier than that would be 1266. 

Although not as widely known, a conflict that took place around 1266 is the Second Barons' War. However, a more famous conflict immortalized in tapestry, which took place even earlier, is the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, approximately 400 years before the Second Barons' War and 460 years before the end of the Thirteen Years' War. The Norman Conquest is famously depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry.
