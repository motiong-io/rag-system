Question: The Pope born Pietro Barbo ended a long-running war two years after his papacy began, which famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry took place 400 years earlier?
Ground truth: The Battle of Hastings.
log:

Generated answer: The Pope born Pietro Barbo, also known as Pope Paul II, ended the War of the Roses' related conflict, the Siege of Barletta in 1466 and more notably he helped to bring an end to the Thirteen Years' War (1454-1466) between the Teutonic Knights and Poland two years after his papacy began.

However, regarding a famous conflict immortalized in tapestry that took place 400 years earlier, I believe you are referring to the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The Battle of Hastings, which took place on October 14, 1066, was a pivotal event in this conflict. 

So, while Pope Paul II was involved in ending a different conflict during his papacy, the famous conflict immortalized in tapestry that took place around 400 years before his time is indeed related to the Norman Conquest and is depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry.
