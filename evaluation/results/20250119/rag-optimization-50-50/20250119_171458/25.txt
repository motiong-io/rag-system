What was the age of Tyson Fury on December 23, 2023?:
Tyson Fury was born on August 12, 1988. To determine his age on December 23, 2023, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

What is the age of Mike Tyson on February 11, 1990?:
According to the text, Mike Tyson was born on June 30, 1966, and the fight against Buster Douglas took place on February 11, 1990. 

To calculate his age at the time of the fight, we need to subtract his birth year from the year of the fight and then account for the months and days.

1990 - 1966 = 24 years

However, since his birthday is June 30, and the fight occurred on February 11, he was still 23 years old at the time of the fight.

The text also confirms this: "Age | 23 years, 7 months" for Mike Tyson.


        


Generated answer: To find the age difference, we need to calculate the ages of Mike Tyson and Tyson Fury on the days they lost their first fights.

Mike Tyson's first loss was on February 11, 1990, and he was 23 years old at that time.

Tyson Fury's first loss was on December 23, 2023, and he was 35 years old at that time.

35 (Tyson Fury's age) - 23 (Mike Tyson's age) = 12 years

So, the age difference is 12 years.
