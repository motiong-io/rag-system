Generated answer: Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to provide a direct answer. The observations I have don't mention the number of employees for either Aon (the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol) or Yum! Brands (the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol) as of 2023.

However, I can tell you that the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol is Aon, and the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol is Yum! Brands. If you provide me with the number of employees for each company, I'd be happy to help you calculate the difference.
