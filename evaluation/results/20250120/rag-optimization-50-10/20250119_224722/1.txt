Generated answer: According to my knowledge, the Dewey Decimal Classification for the Charlotte Brontë book "Jane Eyre" published in 1847 is 823.8. 

If we assume the height of the Bronte Tower is 823.8 feet, we can compare it to the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024.

As of my knowledge cutoff, the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City are:

1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet
2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet
3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet
4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet
5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet

Comparing the height of the Bronte Tower (823.8 feet) to these buildings, it would not be among the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City. In fact, it would be significantly shorter than the top 5.

To give you a better idea, the Bronte Tower would likely be comparable in height to some of the older skyscrapers in New York City, such as the Chrysler Building (1,047 feet, but with a spire that brings the total height to 1,047 feet, the roof height is around 815 feet) or the One Liberty Plaza (743 feet). 

So, the Bronte Tower would likely rank outside of the top 20 tallest buildings in New York City, possibly around 30-40th place, depending on the exact ranking and heights of other buildings in the city.
