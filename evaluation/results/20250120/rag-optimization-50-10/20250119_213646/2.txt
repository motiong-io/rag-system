        In what state is the US capitol located?:
The US Capitol is located in Washington, D.C., which is not a state but a federal district. It is not part of any state, but rather a separate entity that serves as the capital of the United States.

In what year did Punxsutawney Phil start making predictions?:
Punxsutawney Phil's predictions started in 1887, although the folklore and traditions surrounding Groundhog Day have roots that go back even further. According to the provided text, Phil has been sustained by "groundhog punch" or "elixir of life" since 1886, but the formal event began in 1887.

Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to consider the location of the US Capitol and Punxsutawney Phil's predictions. The US Capitol is located in Washington, D.C., which is not a state but a federal district. Punxsutawney Phil, on the other hand, makes his predictions in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Since Punxsutawney Phil's predictions started in 1887, and he is currently located in Pennsylvania, we need to find out if he could have made a prediction in the same state as the US Capitol (i.e., not a state, but rather Washington, D.C.). However, since Washington, D.C. is not a state and Punxsutawney Phil is bound to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania by his lore and tradition, it's unlikely he would make a prediction there.

But if we were to imagine an alternate scenario where Punxsutawney Phil did make predictions in Washington, D.C., we would have to consider how long it would take for him to be "canonically alive" to do so. Given that groundhogs typically live around 10 years in the wild and up to 15 years in captivity, it's unlikely that any single groundhog could have been alive long enough to make predictions across such vast distances.

However, according to the provided text, Punxsutawney Phil has been sustained by "groundhog punch" or "elixir of life" since 1886. Assuming this elixir grants him immortality or significantly extends his lifespan from 1886 onwards, let's calculate how many years earlier he would need to be "canonically alive".

Washington, D.C. was founded in 1790 (as the federal district), but let's assume you're asking how many years before 1887 (when Phil started making predictions) he would need to be alive. 

So if we consider that he needs to be alive during the time when Washington D.C was already established (1790), then:
1887 (start year) - 1790 (founding year) = 97 years

Therefore, Punxsutawney Phil would have needed to be canonically alive at least 97 years earlier than his first recorded prediction in 1887 to potentially make a Groundhog Day prediction around the time when Washington D.C was already established.

Check result: N
