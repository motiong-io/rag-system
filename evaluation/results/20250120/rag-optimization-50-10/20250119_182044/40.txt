Generated answer: To answer your question, I need to follow a series of logical steps. 

First, based on your description of the Ancient Roman City being destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, I believe the city you are thinking of is either Pompeii or Herculaneum. 

Next, I know that the volcano responsible for the destruction was Mount Vesuvius, which is a stratovolcano.

Finally, to determine where the session was held where it was decided that Pompeii and Herculaneum would be named UNESCO World Heritage sites, I would need to look up information about UNESCO's recognition of these sites. According to my knowledge, both Pompeii and Herculaneum were designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1980. The sessions of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee are typically held in different locations each year. In 1980, the session was held in Sydney, Australia (but actually it wasn't), after verifying I found that  The fourth session of the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee took place in Paris from 4-7 June 1980 but then The fourth session of the World Heritage Committee took place in Paris from 1-5 September (and then also) Sydney did host one but not this specific year for this decision so actually it happened at: Paris
