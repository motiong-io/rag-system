Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps.

First, we know that the General Motors vehicle is named after the largest ward in Monaco, which is Monte Carlo. The vehicle is the Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

Next, we need to find out the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo was first introduced in 1970 as a 1970 model.

Now, we need to determine how many people had walked on the moon as of the 1970 model year. Since the model year 1970 refers to cars produced and sold from late 1969 to late 1970, we consider the moonwalks that occurred up to that point.

As of 1970, two missions had successfully landed humans on the Moon: Apollo 11 (in July 1969) and Apollo 12 (in November 1969). The astronauts who walked on the Moon during these missions were Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Pete Conrad, and Alan Bean.

Therefore, as of the first model year (1970) of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, a total of 4 people had walked on the Moon: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Pete Conrad, and Alan Bean.
