It comprises 503 common stocks which are issued by 500 large-cap companies traded on the American stock exchanges (including the 30 companies that compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average). The index includes about 80 percent of the American market by capitalization. It is weighted by free-float market capitalization, so more valuable companies account for relatively more weight in the index. The index constituents and the constituent weights are updated regularly using rules published by S\\&P Dow Jones Indices. Although called the S\\&P 500, the index contains 503 stocks because it includes two share classes of stock from 3 of its component companies.\n\nS\\&P 500 component stocks\n-------------------------\n\n| Symbol | Security | GICS Sector | GICS Sub-Industry | Headquarters Location | Date added | CIK | Founded |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MMM | 3M | Industrials | Industrial Conglomerates | Saint Paul, Minnesota | 1957-03-04 | 0000066740 | 1902 |\n| AOS | A.
