        Who is the Pope born Pietro Barbo?:
The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II.

What long-running war did Pope Paul II end two years after his papacy began?:
None of the provided contexts mention Pope Paul II ending a long-running war. They discuss his conflicts with the Roman Academy, humanist scholars, and King George of Bohemia, but do not mention a specific war being ended by him.

What famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry, took place 400 years earlier than the time when Pope Paul II was two years into his papacy?:
The famous conflict immortalized in tapestry is the Battle of Hastings. It took place in 1066. 

Pope Paul II was two years into his papacy in 1466 (he became pope in 1464). 

Therefore, the Battle of Hastings took place approximately 400 years before 1466, or more precisely, 400 years prior to when Pope Paul II was two years into his papacy.


        


Generated answer: Actually, I must correct you - according to my observations, there is no mention of Pope Paul II (born Pietro Barbo) ending a long-running war two years after his papacy began.

However, I can tell you that the famous conflict immortalized in tapestry that took place 400 years earlier than the time when Pope Paul II was two years into his papacy is the Battle of Hastings, which occurred in 1066. Pope Paul II was two years into his papacy in 1466, so the Battle of Hastings indeed took place approximately 400 years prior to that time.
