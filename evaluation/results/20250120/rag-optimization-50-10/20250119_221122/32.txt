How many times had the Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship as of 2010?:
As of 2010, the Chicago Bulls had won the NBA Championship 6 times: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998.


        


Generated answer: To solve this, we need to know the number of times Brazil won the World Cup, the number of times the Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship, and the number of times the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl as of 2010.

From the given information:
- Brazil won the World Cup 5 times.
- The Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship 6 times.

However, we don't have information on the Dallas Cowboys' Super Bowl wins as of 2010 in the provided observations. But, as of 2010, the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl 5 times (1971, 1977, 1992, 1993, and 1995).

Now, let's calculate:
1. Add the number of times Brazil won the World Cup to the number of times the Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship: 5 (Brazil) + 6 (Chicago Bulls) = 11
2. Multiply this sum by the number of times the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl: 11 * 5 = 55

So, as of 2010, you would be left with 55.

Check result: Y
