        obersevations:
        Which U.S. president won Alaska?:
Alaska was purchased from Russia by the United States in 1867, during the presidency of Andrew Johnson. The purchase was negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, and it was finalized on March 30, 1867. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate on April 9, 1867, and Alaska was officially transferred to the United States on October 18, 1867.

So, while Andrew Johnson was the president at the time of the purchase, it was actually William H. Seward who played a key role in negotiating the deal.

Who is the U.S. president that graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael?:
The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald R. Ford. According to the provided text, Gerald Ford attended Yale Law School and had four children, including Michael, Jack, Steven, and Susan.

What is the middle name of Andrew Johnson?:
Andrew Johnson's full name is Andrew Johnson, he doesn't have a middle name.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to combine the information from the previous observations.

The U.S. president who "won" Alaska is Andrew Johnson, as he was the president during the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.

The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald R. Ford.

Since these are two different presidents, we need to find a common link between them. However, the question seems to be asking about a single president who meets all three criteria.

As it turns out, there is no president who meets all three criteria. Andrew Johnson did not graduate from Yale University and did not have a son named Michael. Gerald Ford did graduate from Yale University and had a son named Michael, but he was not the president who "won" Alaska.

But, if we look at the birth names of these presidents, Andrew Johnson was born with no middle name, while Gerald Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. 

So, as of 2024, at the time of his birth, the middle name of Gerald Ford (the president who graduated from Yale and had a son named Michael) was Lynch.
