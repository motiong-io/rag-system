        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
The text does not specifically mention the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947. However, it does mention that Chelsea was one of the first teams to use numbered shirts in 1928, with numbers assigned by field location (1-11). It also mentions that squad numbers became optional in The Football League in the late 1990s, but does not provide information on the specific numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the 1940s. 

However, based on Context 4 which discusses squad number traditions and player number assignments in association football, specifically in the UK, we can infer that during the traditional 4–4–2 system in the UK, the squad numbers 1–11 would usually have been assigned to players based on their positions on the field. 

Therefore, it is likely that Chelsea FC used a similar numbering system during the years 1945 to 1947, but without more specific information, it is impossible to say for certain.

What position or role did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC, to determine the corresponding squad number?:
Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC. In a traditional 4-4-2 system, the centre-forward is typically assigned the number 9 shirt.


        


Generated answer: Based on the information that Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC, and considering the traditional 4-4-2 system in the UK where the centre-forward is typically assigned the number 9 shirt, it is likely that Tommy Lawton would have worn the number 9 shirt while playing for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.
