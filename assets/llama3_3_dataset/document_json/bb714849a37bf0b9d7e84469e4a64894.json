{"doc_id": "Oldest_football_clubs", "original_uuid": "bb714849a37bf0b9d7e84469e4a64894", "content": "The **oldest football clubs** trace their origins to the mid-19th century, a period when football evolved from being a casual pastime to an organised mainstream sport.\n\nThe identity of the oldest football clubs in the world, or even in a particular country, is often disputed or claimed by several clubs, across several codes of football. The Foot-Ball Club of Edinburgh is thought to be the earliest recorded football club in the world, with records going back to 1824\\. Rugby clubs also referred to themselves, or continue to refer to themselves, as simply a \"football club\", or as a \"rugby football club\". \"Club\" has always meant an independent entity and, during the historical period in question, very few high school or university *teams* were independent of the educational institutions concerned. Consequently, school and university football teams were seldom referred to as \"clubs\". That has always been the case, for example, in American football, which has always had ties to college sport in general. Conversely, however, the *oldest* still-existing \"football club\" with a well-documented, continuous history is Dublin University Football Club, a rugby union club founded in 1854 at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. There exists some record of Guy's Hospital Football Club being founded in London in 1843, through an 1883 fixture card referring to Guy's 40th season.\n\nBritain and Ireland\n-------------------\n\n### Defunct clubs\n\nWhile the first clubs emerged in Britain, possibly as early as the fifteenth century, these are poorly-documented and defunct. For example, the records of the Brewers' Company of London between 1421 and 1423 mention the hiring out of their hall \"by the \"football players\" for \"20 pence\", under the heading \"Trades and Fraternities\". The listing of football players as a \"fraternity\" or a group of players meeting socially under this identity is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club. Other early sporting bodies dedicated to playing football include \"The Gymnastic Society\" of London which met *regularly* during the second half of the eighteenth century to pursue two sports: football and wrestling. The club played its matches \u2013 for example between London-based natives of Cumberland and Westmorland \u2013 at the Kennington Common from well before 1789 until about 1800\\.\n\nThe Foot-Ball Club (active 1824\u201341\\) of Edinburgh, Scotland, is the first documented club dedicated to football, and the first to describe itself as a football club. The only surviving club rules forbade tripping, but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball. Other documents describe a game involving 39 players and \"such kicking of shins and such tumbling\".\n\nOther early clubs include the Great Leicestershire Cricket and Football Club present in 1840\\.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1841, an early documented match between two self-described \"football clubs\" took place. The Body-guard Club (of Rochdale) lost to the Fear-nought Club after using an ineligible player as a substitute. The complete rules used in this game are unknown, but they specified twelve players on each side, with each team providing its own umpire, and the game being started by the firing of a pistol.\n\nA club for playing \"cricket, quoits and football\" was established in Newcastle on Tyne in or before 1848\\. The Surrey Football Club was established in 1849 and published the first non-school football list of rules (which were probably based upon the eighteenth century Gymnastic Society cited above). Windsor Home Park F.C. was in existence as early as 1854, and would go on to compete in early editions of the FA Cup.\n\n### Continuous clubs\n\nSupported by the *Guinness Book of Records*, and founded by staff at Guy's Hospital in London in 1843, the Guy's, Kings and St Thomas' RFC would be the oldest \"football\" club of any code. Nevertheless, the connection between the present club and the original \"Guy's Hospital\" formed in 1843 is still disputed, alleging that the present club is a modern amalgam of three formerly distinct hospital rugby clubs, starting with the Guy's Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital teams which were the first to merge following the union of their respective Medical Departments. The last department to merge was the King's College Hospital in 1999, although its club (founded in 1869\\) remained as a separate institution.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the oldest football club is North of Ireland F.C., formed in 1868\\. It was the first rugby club formed in what is now Northern Ireland and only two other clubs - Dublin University and Wanderers - were formed earlier anywhere else in all Ireland.\n\nIt has been claimed that the present-day Barnes Rugby Football Club, from Barnes in London, is a continuation of the nineteenth-century Barnes Football Club, and moreover that the latter club was formed in 1839 and is thus the oldest club to have played football for its entire history. However, as of 2018, Barnes RFC's website claims only that the club was established in the 1920s, while alluding to \"possibilities\" that its history stretches back to 1862\\. In 2021, people with heritage and local enthusiasts revived the old Barnes Football Club, established in 1862\\.\n\nSheffield F.C. in England, is the world's oldest surviving *independent* open football club: that is, the oldest club not associated with an institution such as a school, hospital or university; and which was open to all to play. It was founded in 1857\\. Sheffield F.C. initially played Sheffield rules, a code of its own devising, although the club's rules influenced those of the England Football Association (FA) (1863\\) including handball, free kicks, corners and throw ins. While the international governing body of association football FIFA and the FA recognise Sheffield F.C. as the \"world's oldest football club\", and the club joined the FA in 1863, it continued to use the Sheffield rules. Sheffield F.C. did not officially adopt association football until 1877\\.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nSetting its birth date in 1856, Cambridge University A.F.C. has been described by the university as the oldest club now playing association football, being recognised by the FA. For example, : \"Salopians formed a club of their own in the late 1830s/early 1840s but that was presumably absorbed by the Cambridge University Football Club that they were so influential in creating in 1846\". According to Charles Astor Bristed, in the early 1840s at Cambridge, there were games played between clubs from colleges and houses. Football is documented as being played on the original club ground, Parker's Piece, as early as 1838\\. The earliest existing evidence of the Cambridge University Football Club comes from \"The Laws of the University Football Club\" dated 1856, and held at Shrewsbury School. The Cambridge rules of 1863 would provide the basis for the FA's original rules.\n\nThe only survivor among the FA's founding clubs still playing association football is Civil Service F.C. Six of the 18 founding members later adopted rugby exclusively. Cray Wanderers F.C., originally of St Mary Cray and currently playing in Bromley, founded in 1860, is the oldest club now playing association football in Greater London. The code played by Cray Wanderers in its earliest years is unknown.\n\nLiverpool Football Club (not to be confused with Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League), later known as Liverpool St Helens F.C., were formed in 1857, which claims to be the oldest open rugby club in the world. The club adopted the Rugby Union rules in 1872, never playing association rules.\nThe first known record of the Club appears under the heading 'Trinity College' in the Daily Express of 1 December 1855 and is taken to show that it had then been in existence for at least a year:\n\nFOOTBALL. - A match will be played in the College Park today (Saturday) between original and new members of the club. Play to commence at two o'clock College time.\n\nThe club had thus been founded by about 1854, and it has a well-documented, continuous history since then, which gives it a strong claim to be considered the world's oldest extant football club of any code.\n\nRest of the world\n-----------------\n\n### Continental Europe\n\nThe first football club to be founded in Albania was the Vllaznia Sport Club on 16 February 1919\\.\n\nThe oldest still active football club is the First Vienna Football Club founded on 22 August 1894\\. Their early rivals, the Vienna Cricket and Football-Club, was founded only one day later.\n\nFootball Club Spa was founded by the Hunter-Blair family of Blairquhan, Ayrshire, Scotland, and was in operation in 1863\\. The fourth Baronet took his family there in order to economise. The oldest club still in existence today in Belgium is Royal Antwerp FC, founded in 1880\\.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nThe oldest football club in Bosnia and Herzegovina is FK Sloboda founded in Novi Grad in 1910\\. The first club to be ever founded was Zrinjski Mostar in 1905, but it was inactive between 1945 and 1992\\.\n\nBotev Plovdiv is one of the oldest football club in Bulgaria founded in 1912\\.\n\nOldest and most successful Czech football club is Sparta Prague founded in 1893\\. The club still exists and plays Chance Liga, first division of Czech football.\n\nThe oldest still active football club in Croatia is NK Rijeka, formed in 1904 and playing association football at the latest in 1906, currently competing in the first Croatian league. HNK Segesta, that plays in the third division, was possibly founded in 1906, but its first recorded match was held in 1909\\.\n\nAnorthosis Famagusta FC founded in 1911 is the oldest club with a football team, however it was a reading club and the football division of the club started in 1929, the same year Omonia Aradippou was founded. The now defunct football division of Enosis Neon Trust founded in 1924 is therefore the oldest football club, however the club closed its football division in 1938\\. The oldest surviving football club is therefore APOEL founded in 1926\\. The same year the now defunct Keravnos Strovolou FC was founded. The now defunct Pezoporikos Larnaca FC was founded in 1927 first merging to form EPA Larnaca FC in 1930\\. AEL Limassol and Aris Limassol both founded in 1930 and one year after the Anorthosis football division are therefore old clubs as well. Olympiakos Nicosia and Digenis Akritas Morphou FC were both subsequently founded in 1931\\.\n\nKj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub is the oldest football club in Denmark and the oldest active club in continental Europe. The sports club was formed in 1876 and association football was first played two years later.\n\nEstonian Sports Association Kalev (Estonian: Eesti Spordiselts Kalev) is a sports association in Estonia, founded in 1901\\.\n\nIn nowadays Estonian state was the oldest formed club Tallinna Jalgpalliselts Meteor in 1908\\.

The football contests take place in the Bois de Boulogne, by permission of the authorities and surprise the French amazingly\".\n\nLe Havre AC was founded as an athletics and rugby club in 1872, making it the oldest surviving football club registered in France and continental Europe. They began playing association football on a regular basis in 1894\\. Technically AS Strasbourg could be considered the first French association football team, being established in 1890; they were however a German team at the time.\n\nThe oldest surviving rugby football club is Heidelberger RK, which was founded on 9 May 1872 as a rowing and rugby club. The HRK has won 14 national titles 1927, 1928, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1986, 2010\u20132015, 2017 and 2018\\. The biggest success of the club was the qualification for the Rugby European Challenge Cup 2018/19 - only to be denied participation, because their main sponsor owns Stade Fran\u00e7ais. The second oldest still surviving rugby club is Hannover 1878 founded 1878 and winning 9 German championships. Both clubs still play in the 1\\. Bundesliga.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nThe first association football in Germany (and likely the first outside Great Britain) was Dresden English, founded on 18 March 1874\\. The club had over 70 members by then, primarily Englishmen working in Dresden, with its matches being attended by hundreds of spectators. Nevertheless, Dresden English was dissolved in 1898\\.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nThe oldest still active association football club is BFC Germania 1888 founded on 15 April 1888\\.

The club was relocated to Greece in 1922\\.\n\nThe oldest still active football club in Hungary is \u00dajpest Torna Egylet, founded in 1885\\. There are other old teams like M\u0171egyetemi AFC founded in autumn 1897 as a proper football club and III. Ker\u00fcleti TVE, which whose football section was founded officially in 1899 but stemmed from the 1897-founded Budai Football Csapat. The first ever football club to be founded in Hungary was Budapesti Torna Club having founded its football section in February 1897, dissolved in 1945\u201346\\.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nIn Italy, Genoa C.F.C. is the oldest active football club: it was founded by Charles De Grave Sells, S. Green, George Blake, W. Rilley, George Dormer Fawcus, H.M. Sandys, E. De Thierry, Johnathan Summerhill Sr., Johnathan Summerhill Jr. and Sir Charles Alfred Payton in Genoa on 7 September 1893\\. However, Genoa C.F.C. was not the first Italian football club, being Torino Football \\& Cricket Club (1887\\) but its history lasted only for 4 years. Founded by Edoardo Bosio (owner of Bosio \\& Caratsch, the earliest brewery in Italy), the team broke up in 1891\\. Older than Genoa and Torino is Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Fanfulla, a sports club founded in Lodi in 1873, but its football section was established thirty-five years later in 1908\\.\n\nWorkers at the (British-owned) Salamandra metal factory in Riga founded the first football team in 1907: the British Football Club (later named Britannia).\n\nThe first inter-city football games are dating back to 1911\\. Shortly after gaining the independence in 1918, a Kybartai local of a German descent has purchased a ball, leveled out a football pitch, and gathered a team together. The team formed into a football club FK Sveikata in 1919\\.

The game played by the club, known as the \"Boston game\", was an informal local variant that predated the codification of rules for either association or American football. The team, which consisted of graduates of Boston's elite preparatory schools, played on Boston Common from 1862 to 1865, during which time they reportedly never lost a game or even gave up a single point.\n\nIn terms of gridiron football, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League can trace their roots back to the Hamilton Football Club (nicknamed the *Tigers*) which formed in 1869, then later merged with the Hamilton Wildcats in 1950 to form the current franchise. Their rivals to the east, the Toronto Argonauts, were founded four years later, in 1873, and have a mostly unchanged franchise history. Both clubs began as rugby football clubs and only later adapted to the gridiron-style of play which would become known as Canadian football. The oldest continuous rugby club in North America which still plays rugby is the McGill University Rugby Football Club, which was established in 1863, although their first recorded game was not until 1865\\. The oldest independent (non-university) rugby club is the Westmount Rugby Club of Montreal, which formed in 1876\\.\n\nIn 1869, Rutgers University and Princeton University competed in the first US intercollegiate football game. According to U.S. Soccer, the rules of this game resembled rugby and association football more closely than gridiron football. However, university-affiliated teams competing in intercollegiate championships are not typically classified as \"clubs\".\n\nIn the United States, gridiron-based variants of the game did not distinguish themselves from existing codes until 1871, when Harvard University began playing the Boston Game invented by Oneida. Its rules allowed a player to pick up the ball and run with it if he were chased and it quickly spread, with innovations added by Yale University student Walter Camp. The oldest existing non-university semiprofessional football club is the Watertown Red \\& Black, which was founded in 1896\\. The Arizona Cardinals, founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in Chicago in 1898, are the oldest team in the National Football League.\n\nOne of the first teams to have played football under the association rules in the US was Fall River Rovers, founded in 1884\\.

Founded in 1993, both Charleston Battery and Richmond Kickers are considered the oldest continuously operating professional soccer clubs in the United States to date. The ten charter members of Major League Soccer were all new clubs created shortly before the league began play in 1996\\. Nine of those ten clubs are still in existence. In 2011, the league admitted the Vancouver Whitecaps, who had existed continuously since 1986, and who were a phoenix club of the North American Soccer League side of the same name who were founded in 1974\\. Aside from the arguable exception of the Whitecaps, all of the other NASL clubs folded when the league folded in 1984\\. There is one American soccer club from an earlier first-division league still in existence: the Kearny Scots of the semi-pro Eastern Premier Soccer League have been around since the 1930s, when they were a longtime member of the American Soccer League. They won the ASL league championship five years in a row from 1937 through 1941\\.\n\nIn Mexico, the oldest Football club is Club de F\u00fatbol Pachuca, based in Pachuca, Hidalgo, that competes in Liga MX.

According to the club's website, the club was founded before 8 December 1864 as a cricket institution. The date of foundation has been recognised by the Buenos Aires Rugby Union. It is however believed that the club was founded in 1831, with existing documentary evidence about a cricket match played by Buenos Aires that same year. Nevertheless, the practise of any \"football\" code did not start until 1951 when the BACC merged with the Buenos Aires F.C. and rugby union was added.\n\nClub Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario was officially established in 1867 as a cricket institution. The club soon added association football, being the first club from Rosario playing in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n, the top division of Argentina. In rugby union, Rosario AC played the first inter-clubs match in the country on 28 June 1886, when the team faced Buenos Aires Football Club.\n\nHaving been established in 1875, Club Mercedes is considered the oldest association football club still in existence in Argentina. This places Mercedes above Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata and Quilmes, both founded in 1887\\.\n\nOruro Royal was founded on 26 May 1896 by the English workers hired by the Bolivian Government to build the national railways, becoming the first Bolivian football squad.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo Athletic Club, founded on 13 May 1888 by English immigrants as a cricket club, could be considered the oldest Brazilian club to have played any code of \"football\", starting to play association football in 1898\\.
