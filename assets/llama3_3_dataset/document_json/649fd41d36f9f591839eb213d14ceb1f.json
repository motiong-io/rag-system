The name *Kodansha* (taken from *K\u014ddan Club* (\u8b1b\u8ac7\u5036\u697d\u90e8), a now-defunct magazine published by the company) originated in 1911 when the publisher formally merged with the *Dai-Nippon Y\u016bbenkai*. The company has used its current legal name since 1958\\. It uses the motto *\"omoshirokute, tame ni naru\"* (\u9762\u767d\u304f\u3066\u3001\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306a\u308b, \"To be interesting and beneficial\").\n\nKodansha Limited owns the Otowa Group, which manages subsidiary companies such as King Records (official name: King Record Co., Ltd.) and Kobunsha, and publishes *Nikkan Gendai,* a daily tabloid. It also has close ties with Disney and officially sponsors Tokyo Disneyland.\n\nKodansha is the largest publisher in Japan.\\[*citation needed*] Revenues dropped due to the 2002 recession in Japan and an accompanying downturn in the publishing industry: the company posted a loss in the 2002 financial year for the first time since the end of World War II. (The second-largest publisher, Shogakukan, has done relatively better. In the 2003 financial year, Kodansha had revenues of \u00a5167 billion compared to \u00a5150 billion for Shogakukan. Kodansha, at its peak, led Shogakukan by over \u00a550 billion in revenue.)\\[*citation needed*]\n\nKodansha sponsors the Kodansha Manga Award which has run since 1977 (and since 1960 under other names).\\[*citation needed*]\n\nKodansha's headquarters in Tokyo once housed Noma D\u014dj\u014d, a kendo practice-hall established by Seiji Noma in 1925\\. However, the hall was demolished in November 2007 and replaced with a d\u014dj\u014d in a new building nearby.\n\nThe company announced that it was closing its English-language publishing house, Kodansha International, at the end of April 2011\\. Their American publishing house, Kodansha USA, will remain in operation.\n\nKodansha USA began issuing new publications under the head administrator of the international branch, Kentaro Tsugumi, starting in September 2012 with a hardcover release of *The Spirit of Aikido.* Many of Kodansha USA's older titles have been reprinted. According to Daniel Mani of Kodansha USA, Inc., \"Though we did stopped \\[*sic*] publishing new books for about a year starting from late 2011, we did continue to sell most of our older title throughout that period (so Kodansha USA never actually closed).\"\\[*citation needed*]\n\nIn October 2016, Kodansha acquired publisher Ichijinsha and turned the company into its wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, Kodansha announced an extended partnership with Disney to release anime originals based on its manga exclusively on video streaming service Disney\\+ starting with the second season of *Tokyo Revengers*.\n\nOn March 21, 2023, Kodansha announced a manga distribution service called \"K Manga\" which was initially launched exclusively in the United States on May 10, 2023\\. It started approximately with 400 titles, of which 70 were simultaneous publications of ongoing series. On October 21, 2024, it was announced that the service became available in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.\n\nOn May 24, 2024, Kodansha announced that they acquired publisher Wani Books and turned it into a wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nRelationships with other organizations\n--------------------------------------\n\n| This section **does not cite any sources**.

It also owns shares in Nippon Cultural Broadcasting and Kobunsha. In the 2005 takeover-war for Nippon Broadcasting System between Livedoor and Fuji TV, Kodansha supported Fuji TV by selling its stock to Fuji TV.\n\n### NHK\n\nKodansha has a somewhat complicated relationship with NHK (Nippon Housou Kyoukai), Japan's public broadcaster. Many of the manga and novels published by Kodansha have spawned anime adaptations. Animation such as *Cardcaptor Sakura*, aired in NHK's *Eisei Anime Gekij\u014d* time-slot, and Kodansha published a companion magazine to the NHK children's show *Ok\u0101san to Issho*. The two companies often clash editorially, however. The October 2000 issue of *Gendai* accused NHK of staging footage used in a news report in 1997 on dynamite fishing in Indonesia. NHK sued Kodansha in the Tokyo District Court, which ordered Kodansha to publish a retraction and pay \u00a54 million in damages. Kodansha appealed the decision and reached a settlement whereby it had to issue only a partial retraction and to pay no damages.\\[*unreliable source?*] *Gendai*'s sister magazine *Sh\u016bkan Gendai* nonetheless published an article probing further into the staged-footage controversy that has dogged NHK.\n\nHonors\n------\n\n* Japan Foundation: Japan Foundation Special Prize, 1994\\.\n\nList of magazines\n-----------------\n\n### Manga magazines\n\nThis is a list of manga magazines published by Kodansha.\n\n***Kodomo* (children's) manga magazines**\n\n* *Comic BomBom* (1981\u20132007\\)\n\n***Sh\u014dnen* manga magazines**\n\n* *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine* (since 1959\\)\n* *Monthly Sh\u014dnen Magazine* (since 1975\\)\n* *Sh\u014dnen Sirius* (monthly since 2005\\)\n* *Bessatsu Sh\u014dnen Magazine* (monthly since 2009\\)\n* *Suiy\u014dbi no Sirius* (website, since 2013\\)\n* *Magazine Pocket* (app/website, since 2015\\)\n* *Monthly Maga Kichi* (website since 2023\\)\n\n* *Sh\u014dnen Club* (1914\u20131962\\)\n* *Monthly Manga Sh\u014dnen* (1947\u20131955\\)\n* *Bokura* (1954-1969\\)\n* *Magazine Special* (1983\u20132017\\)\n* *Monthly Sh\u014dnen Magazine GREAT* (1993\u20132009\\)\n* *Monthly Sh\u014dnen Rival* (2008\u20132014\\)\n* *Magazine E-no* (2009\u20132011\\)\n* *Monthly Shonen Magazine\\+* (2011\u20132014\\)\n* *Sh\u014dnen Magazine R* (2015\u20132023\\)\n* *Sh\u014dnen Magazine Edge* (2015\u20132023\\)\n\n***Seinen* manga magazines**\n\n* *Weekly Young Magazine* (since 1980\\)\n* *Monthly Young Magazine* (since 2009\\)\n* *Morning* (weekly since 1982; originally called *Comic Morning*)\n* *Afternoon* (monthly, since 1986\\)\n* *Good!

Many of the manga and novels published by Kodansha have spawned anime adaptations. Animation such as *Cardcaptor Sakura*, aired in NHK's *Eisei Anime Gekij\u014d* time-slot, and Kodansha published a companion magazine to the NHK children's show *Ok\u0101san to Issho*. The two companies often clash editorially, however. The October 2000 issue of *Gendai* accused NHK of staging footage used in a news report in 1997 on dynamite fishing in Indonesia. NHK sued Kodansha in the Tokyo District Court, which ordered Kodansha to publish a retraction and pay \u00a54 million in damages. Kodansha appealed the decision and reached a settlement whereby it had to issue only a partial retraction and to pay no damages.\\[*unreliable source?*] *Gendai*'s sister magazine *Sh\u016bkan Gendai* nonetheless published an article probing further into the staged-footage controversy that has dogged NHK.", "contextualized_text": "This chunk is part of the \"Relationships with other organizations\" section of the article about Kodansha Ltd., a Japanese publishing company, specifically describing its connection with NHK, Japan's public broadcaster."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Kodansha_15", "original_index": 15, "content": "Honors\n------\n\n* Japan Foundation: Japan Foundation Special Prize, 1994\\.\n\nList of magazines\n-----------------\n\n### Manga magazines\n\nThis is a list of manga magazines published by Kodansha.\n\n***Kodomo* (children's) manga magazines**\n\n* *Comic BomBom* (1981\u20132007\\)\n\n***Sh\u014dnen* manga magazines**\n\n* *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine* (since 1959\\)\n* *Monthly Sh\u014dnen Magazine* (since 1975\\)\n* *Sh\u014dnen Sirius* (monthly since 2005\\)\n* *Bessatsu Sh\u014dnen Magazine* (monthly since 2009\\)\n* *Suiy\u014dbi no Sirius* (website, since 2013\\)\n* *Magazine Pocket* (app/website, since 2015\\)\n* *Monthly Maga Kichi* (website since 2023\\)\n\n* *Sh\u014dnen Club* (1914\u20131962\\)\n* *Monthly Manga Sh\u014dnen* (1947\u20131955\\)\n* *Bokura* (1954-1969\\)\n* *Magazine Special* (1983\u20132017\\)\n* *Monthly Sh\u014dnen Magazine GREAT* (1993\u20132009\\)\n* *Monthly Sh\u014dnen Rival* (2008\u20132014\\)\n* *Magazine E-no* (2009\u20132011\\)\n* *Monthly Shonen Magazine\\+* (2011\u20132014\\)\n* *Sh\u014dnen Magazine R* (2015\u20132023\\)\n* *Sh\u014dnen Magazine Edge* (2015\u20132023\\)\n\n***Seinen* manga magazines**", "contextualized_text": "This chunk is situated in the article about Kodansha Ltd., a Japanese publishing company, and specifically describes the company's honors and list of published manga magazines, as part of the overall article about the company's history, products, and activities."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Kodansha_16", "original_index": 16, "content": "***Seinen* manga magazines**\n\n* *Weekly Young Magazine* (since 1980\\)\n* *Monthly Young Magazine* (since 2009\\)\n* *Morning* (weekly since 1982; originally called *Comic Morning*)\n* *Afternoon* (monthly, since 1986\\)\n* *Good!
