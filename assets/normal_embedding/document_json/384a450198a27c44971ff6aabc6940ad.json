She is best known for her novel *Jane Eyre*, which she published under the male pseudonym **Currer Bell**. *Jane Eyre* went on to become a success in publication, and is widely held in high regard in the gothic fiction genre of literature.\n\nBront\u00eb enrolled in school at Roe Head, Mirfield, in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, then returned to Roe Head in 1835 as a teacher. In 1839, she undertook the role of governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months. The three sisters attempted to open a school in Haworth but failed to attract pupils. Instead, they turned to writing; they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Although her first novel, *The Professor*, was rejected by publishers, her second novel, *Jane Eyre*, was published in 1847\\. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles.\n\nBront\u00eb was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her wedding in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855, almost certainly from hyperemesis gravidarum, a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting.\\[a]\n\nEarly years and education\n-------------------------\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb was born on 21 April 1816 in Market Street, Thornton (in a house now known as the Bront\u00eb Birthplace), west of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the third of the six children of Maria (n\u00e9e Branwell) and Patrick Bront\u00eb (formerly surnamed Brunty), an Irish Anglican clergyman. In 1820 her family moved a few miles to the village of Haworth, on the edge of the moors, where her father had been appointed perpetual curate of St Michael and All Angels Church. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and a son, Branwell, to be taken care of by her sister, Elizabeth Branwell.\n\nIn August 1824, Patrick sent Charlotte, Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire. Charlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814\\) and Elizabeth (born 1815\\), who both died of tuberculosis in May (Maria) and June (Elizabeth) 1825\\. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in *Jane Eyre,* which is similarly affected by tuberculosis that is exacerbated by the poor conditions.\n\nAt home in Haworth Parsonage, Bront\u00eb acted as \"the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters\". Bront\u00eb wrote her first known poem at the age of 13 in 1829, and was to go on to write more than 200 poems in the course of her life. Many of her poems were \"published\" in their homemade magazine *Branwell's Blackwood's Magazine*, and concerned the fictional world of *Glass Town*. She and her surviving siblings \u2013 Branwell, Emily and Anne \u2013 created this shared world, and began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdom in 1827\\. Charlotte, in private letters, called *Glass Town* \"her 'world below', a private escape where she could act out her desires and multiple identities\". Charlotte's \"predilection for romantic settings, passionate relationships, and high society is at odds with Branwell's obsession with battles and politics and her young sisters' homely North Country realism, none the less at this stage there is still a sense of the writings as a family enterprise\".\n\nHowever, from 1831 onwards, Emily and Anne 'seceded' from the *Glass Town Confederacy* to create a 'spin-off' called *Gondal*, which included many of their poems. After 1831, Charlotte and Branwell concentrated on an evolution of the *Glass Town Confederacy* called *Angria*. Christine Alexander, a Bront\u00eb juvenilia historian, wrote \"both Charlotte and Branwell ensured the consistency of their imaginary world. When Branwell exuberantly kills off important characters in his manuscripts, Charlotte comes to the rescue and, in effect, resurrects them for the next stories \\[...]; and when Branwell becomes bored with his inventions, such as the Glass Town magazine he edits, Charlotte takes over his initiative and keeps the publication going for several more years\".:\u200a6\u20137 The sagas the siblings created were episodic and elaborate, and they exist in incomplete manuscripts, some of which have been published as juvenilia. They provided them with an obsessive interest during childhood and early adolescence, which prepared them for literary vocations in adulthood.\n\nBetween 1831 and 1832, Bront\u00eb continued her education at a boarding school twenty miles away in Mirfield, Roe Head (now part of Hollybank Special School), where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor. In 1833 she wrote a novella, *The Green Dwarf*, using the name Wellesley. Around about 1833, her stories shifted from tales of the supernatural to more realistic stories. She returned to Roe Head as a teacher from 1835 to 1838\\. Unhappy and lonely as a teacher at Roe Head, Bront\u00eb took out her sorrows in poetry, writing a series of melancholic poems. In \"We wove a Web in Childhood\" written in December 1835, Bront\u00eb drew a sharp contrast between her miserable life as a teacher and the vivid imaginary worlds she and her siblings had created. In another poem \"Morning was its freshness still\" written at the same time, Bront\u00eb wrote \"Tis bitter sometimes to recall/Illusions once deemed fair\". Many of her poems concerned the imaginary world of Angria, often concerning Byronic heroes, and in December 1836 she wrote to the Poet Laureate Robert Southey asking him for encouragement of her career as a poet. Southey replied, famously, that \"Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and it ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation.\" This advice she respected but did not heed.\n\nIn 1839 Bront\u00eb took up the first of many positions as governess to families in Yorkshire, a career she pursued until 1841\\. In particular, from May to July 1839 she was employed by the Sidgwick family at their summer residence, Stone Gappe, in Lothersdale, where one of her charges was John Benson Sidgwick (1835\u20131927\\), an unruly child who on one occasion threw the Bible at Charlotte, an incident that may have been the inspiration for a part of the opening chapter of *Jane Eyre* in which John Reed throws a book at the young Jane. Bront\u00eb did not enjoy her work as a governess, noting her employers treated her almost as a slave, constantly humiliating her. She was of slight build and was less than five feet tall.\n\nBrussels and Haworth\n--------------------\n\nIn 1842 Charlotte and Emily travelled to Brussels to enrol at the boarding school run by Constantin H\u00e9ger (1809\u20131896\\) and his wife Claire Zo\u00e9 Parent H\u00e9ger (1804\u20131887\\). During her time in Brussels, Bront\u00eb, who favoured the Protestant ideal of an individual in direct contact with God, objected to the stern Catholicism of Madame H\u00e9ger, which she considered a tyrannical religion that enforced conformity and submission to the Pope. In return for board and tuition Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the school was cut short when their aunt Elizabeth Branwell, who had joined the family in Haworth to look after the children after their mother's death, died of internal obstruction in October 1842\\. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the school. Her second stay was not happy: she was homesick and deeply attached to Constantin H\u00e9ger. She returned to Haworth in January 1844 and used the time spent in Brussels as the inspiration for some of the events in *The Professor* and *Villette*.\n\nAfter returning to Haworth, Charlotte and her sisters made headway with opening their own boarding school in the family home. It was advertised as \"The Misses Bront\u00eb's Establishment for the Board and Education of a limited number of Young Ladies\" and inquiries were made to prospective pupils and sources of funding. But none were attracted and in October 1844, the project was abandoned.\n\nFirst publication\n-----------------\n\nIn May 1846, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne self-financed the publication of a joint collection of poems under their assumed names Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The pseudonyms veiled the sisters' sex while preserving their initials; thus Charlotte was Currer Bell. \"Bell\" was the middle name of Haworth's curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls whom Charlotte later married, and \"Currer\" was the surname of Frances Mary Richardson Currer who had funded their school (and maybe their father). Of the decision to use *noms de plume*, Charlotte wrote:\n\n Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because \u2013 without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called \"feminine\" \u2013 we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.\n\nAlthough only two copies of the collection of poems were sold, the sisters continued writing for publication and began their first novels, continuing to use their *noms de plume* when sending manuscripts to potential publishers.\n\n*The Professor* and *Jane Eyre*\n-------------------------------\n\nBront\u00eb's first manuscript, 'The Professor', did not secure a publisher, although she was heartened by an encouraging response from Smith, Elder \\& Co. of Cornhill, who expressed an interest in any longer works Currer Bell might wish to send. Bront\u00eb responded by finishing and sending a second manuscript in August 1847\\. Six weeks later, *Jane Eyre* was published. It tells the story of a plain governess, Jane, who, after difficulties in her early life, falls in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. They marry, but only after Rochester's insane first wife, of whom Jane initially has no knowledge, dies in a dramatic house fire. The book's style was innovative, combining Romanticism, naturalism with gothic melodrama, and broke new ground in being written from an intensely evoked first-person female perspective. Bront\u00eb believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in *Jane Eyre* she transformed the experience into a novel with universal appeal.\n\n*Jane Eyre* had immediate commercial success and initially received favourable reviews. G. H. Lewes wrote that it was \"an utterance from the depths of a struggling, suffering, much-enduring spirit\", and declared that it consisted of \"*suspiria de profundis*!\" (sighs from the depths). Speculation about the identity and gender of the mysterious Currer Bell heightened with the publication of *Wuthering Heights* by Ellis Bell (Emily) and *Agnes Grey* by Acton Bell (Anne). Accompanying the speculation was a change in the critical reaction to Bront\u00eb's work, as accusations were made that the writing was \"coarse\", a judgement more readily made once it was suspected that Currer Bell was a woman. However, sales of *Jane Eyre* continued to be strong and may even have increased as a result of the novel developing a reputation as an \"improper\" book. A talented amateur artist, Bront\u00eb personally did the drawings for the second edition of *Jane Eyre* and in the summer of 1834 two of her paintings were shown at an exhibition by the Royal Northern Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Leeds.\n\n*Shirley* and bereavements\n--------------------------\n\nIn 1848 Bront\u00eb began work on the manuscript of her second novel, Shirley. It was only partially completed when the Bront\u00eb family suffered the deaths of three of its members within eight months. In September 1848 Branwell died of chronic bronchitis and marasmus, exacerbated by heavy drinking, although Bront\u00eb believed that his death was due to tuberculosis. Branwell may have had a laudanum addiction. Emily became seriously ill shortly after his funeral and died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848\\. Anne died of the same disease in May 1849\\. Bront\u00eb was unable to write at this time.\n\nAfter Anne's death Bront\u00eb resumed writing as a way of dealing with her grief, and *Shirley*, which deals with themes of industrial unrest and the role of women in society, was published in October 1849\\. Unlike *Jane Eyre*, which is written in the first person, *Shirley* is written in the third person and lacks the emotional immediacy of her first novel, and reviewers found it less shocking. Bront\u00eb, as her late sister's heir, suppressed the republication of Anne's second novel, *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall*, an action which had a deleterious effect on Anne's popularity as a novelist and has remained controversial among the sisters' biographers ever since.\n\nIn society\n----------\n\nIn view of the success of her novels, particularly *Jane Eyre*, Bront\u00eb was persuaded by her publisher to make occasional visits to London, where she revealed her true identity and began to move in more exalted social circles, becoming friends with Elizabeth Gaskell and Harriet Martineau whose sister Rachel had taught Gaskell's daughters. Bront\u00eb sent an early copy of *Shirley* to Martineau whose home at Ambleside she visited. The two friends shared an interest in racial relations and the abolitionist movement; recurrent themes in their writings. Bront\u00eb was also acquainted with William Makepeace Thackeray and G. H. Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time, as she did not want to leave her ageing father. Thackeray's daughter, writer Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie, recalled a visit to her father by Bront\u00eb:\n\n ...two gentlemen come in, leading a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, with fair straight hair and steady eyes. She may be a little over thirty; she is dressed in a little *bar\u00e8ge* dress with a pattern of faint green moss. She enters in mittens, in silence, in seriousness; our hearts are beating with wild excitement. This then is the authoress, the unknown power whose books have set all London talking, reading, speculating; some people even say our father wrote the books \u2013 the wonderful books. ...The moment is so breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the occasion, and we all smile as my father stoops to offer his arm; for, genius though she may be, Miss Bront\u00eb can barely reach his elbow. My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and stern, specially to forward little girls who wish to chatter. ...Everyone waited for the brilliant conversation which never began at all. Miss Bront\u00eb retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to our kind governess... the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all... after Miss Bront\u00eb had left, I was surprised to see my father opening the front door with his hat on. He put his fingers to his lips, walked out into the darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him... long afterwards... Mrs Procter asked me if I knew what had happened. ...It was one of the dullest evenings \\[Mrs Procter] had ever spent in her life... the ladies who had all come expecting so much delightful conversation, and the gloom and the constraint, and how finally, overwhelmed by the situation, my father had quietly left the room, left the house, and gone off to his club.\n\nBront\u00eb's friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell, while not particularly close, was significant in that Gaskell wrote the first biography of Bront\u00eb after her death in 1855\\.\n\n*Villette*\n----------\n\nBront\u00eb's third novel, the last published in her lifetime, was *Villette*, which appeared in 1853\\. Its main themes include isolation, how such a condition can be borne, and the internal conflict brought about by social repression of individual desire. Its main character, Lucy Snowe, travels abroad to teach in a boarding school in the fictional town of Villette, where she encounters a culture and religion different from her own and falls in love with a man (Paul Emanuel) whom she cannot marry. Her experiences result in a breakdown but eventually, she achieves independence and fulfilment through running her own school. A substantial amount of the novel's dialogue is in the French language. *Villette* marked Bront\u00eb's return to writing from a first-person perspective (that of Lucy Snowe), the technique she had used in *Jane Eyre*. Another similarity to *Jane Eyre* lies in the use of aspects of her own life as inspiration for fictional events, in particular her reworking of the time she spent at the *pensionnat* in Brussels. *Villette* was acknowledged by critics of the day as a potent and sophisticated piece of writing although it was criticised for \"coarseness\" and for not being suitably \"feminine\" in its portrayal of Lucy's desires.\n\nMarriage\n--------\n\nBefore the publication of *Villette*, Bront\u00eb received an expected proposal of marriage from Irishman Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's curate, who had long been in love with her. She initially refused him and her father objected to the union at least partly because of Nicholls's poor financial status. Elizabeth Gaskell, who believed that marriage provided \"clear and defined duties\" that were beneficial for a woman, encouraged Bront\u00eb to consider the positive aspects of such a union and tried to use her contacts to engineer an improvement in Nicholls's finances. According to James Pope-Hennessy in *The Flight of Youth,* it was the generosity of Richard Monckton Milnes that made the marriage possible. Bront\u00eb, meanwhile, was increasingly attracted to Nicholls and by January 1854, she had accepted his proposal. They gained the approval of her father by April and married on 29 June. Her father Patrick had intended to give Charlotte away, but at the last minute decided he could not, and Charlotte had to make her way to the church without him.\nBecause her father did not attend it was Miss Wooler (Charlotte's former teacher at Roe Head School, and life-long friend), as \"friend\", who \"gave away\" Charlotte (Gaskell: Vol II, Chap XIII).\nThe married couple took their honeymoon in Banagher, County Offaly, Ireland. By all accounts, her marriage was a success and Bront\u00eb found herself very happy in a way that was new to her.\n\nDeath\n-----\n\nBront\u00eb became pregnant soon after her wedding, but her health declined rapidly and, according to Gaskell, she was attacked by \"sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness\". She died, with her unborn child, on 31 March 1855, three weeks before her 39th birthday. Her death certificate gives the cause of death as phthisis, but biographers including Claire Harman and others suggest that she died from dehydration and malnourishment due to vomiting caused by severe morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum. Bront\u00eb was buried in the family vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels at Haworth.\n\n*The Professor*, the first novel Bront\u00eb had written, was published posthumously in 1857\\. The fragment of a new novel she had been writing in her last years has been twice completed by recent authors, the more famous version being *Emma Brown: A Novel from the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Bront\u00eb* by Clare Boylan in 2003\\. Most of her writings about the imaginary country Angria have also been published since her death. In 2018, *The New York Times* published a belated obituary for her.\n\nReligion\n--------\n\nThe daughter of an Irish Anglican clergyman, Bront\u00eb was herself an Anglican. In a letter to her publisher, she claims to \"love the Church of England. Her Ministers indeed, I do not regard as infallible personages, I have seen too much of them for that \u2013 but to the Establishment, with all her faults \u2013 the profane Athanasian Creed excluded \u2013 I am sincerely attached.\"\n\nIn a letter to Ellen Nussey she wrote:\n\nIf I could always live with you, and daily read the bible with you, if your lips and mine could at the same time, drink the same draught from the same pure fountain of Mercy \u2013 I hope, I trust, I might one day become better, far better, than my evil wandering thoughts, my corrupt heart, cold to the spirit, and warm to the flesh will now permit me to be.\n\n*The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb*\n------------------------------\n\nElizabeth Gaskell's biography *The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb* was published in 1857\\. It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another, and Gaskell's approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject's achievements, she concentrated on private details of Bront\u00eb's life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of \"coarseness\" that had been levelled at her writing. The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Bront\u00eb's love for H\u00e9ger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Bront\u00eb's father, widower, and friends. Mrs. Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Bront\u00eb, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Bront\u00eb's diary papers, in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage. It has been argued that Gaskell's approach transferred the focus of attention away from the 'difficult' novels, not just Bront\u00eb's, but all the sisters', and began a process of sanctification of their private lives.\n\nNussey letters\n--------------\n\nBront\u00eb held lifelong correspondence with her former schoolmate Ellen Nussey. 350 of the some 500 letters sent by Bront\u00eb to Nussey survive, whereas all of Nussey's letters to Bront\u00eb were burned at Nicholls's request. The surviving letters provide most of the information known on Charlotte Bront\u00eb's life and are the backbone of her autobiographies.\n\nBront\u00eb's letters to Nussey seem to have romantic undertones:\n\nWhat shall I do without you? How long are we likely to be separated? Why are we to be denied each other's society- I long to be with you. Why are we to be divided? Surely, Ellen, it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well-\n\nEllen, I wish I could live with you always. I begin to cling to you more fondly than ever I did. If we had but a cottage and a competency of our own, I do think we might live and love on till Death without being dependent on any third person for happiness...\n\n\nhow sorely my heart longs for you I need not say... Less than ever can I taste or know pleasure till this work is wound up. And yet I often sit up in bed at night, thinking of and wishing for you.\n\nSome scholars believe it is possible that Charlotte Bront\u00eb was in a romantic or sexual relationship with Ellen Nussey.\n\nH\u00e9ger letters\n-------------\n\nOn 29 July 1913 *The Times* of London printed four letters Bront\u00eb had written to Constantin H\u00e9ger after leaving Brussels in 1844\\. Written in French except for one postscript in English, the letters broke the prevailing image of Bront\u00eb as an angelic martyr to Christian and female duties that had been constructed by many biographers, beginning with Gaskell. The letters, which formed part of a larger and somewhat one-sided correspondence in which H\u00e9ger frequently appears not to have replied, reveal that she had been in love with a married man, although they are complex and have been interpreted in numerous ways, including as an example of literary self-dramatisation and an expression of gratitude from a former pupil.\n\nIn 1980 a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, on the site of the Madam Heger's school, in honour of Charlotte and Emily.\n\nLegacy\n------\n\nKazuo Ishiguro, when asked to name his favourite novelist, answered \"Charlotte Bront\u00eb's recently edged out Dostoevsky...I owe my career, and a lot else besides, to *Jane Eyre* and *Villette.*\"\n\nPublications\n------------\n\n### Juvenilia\n\n* *The Young Men's Magazine, Number 1 \u2013 3* (August 1830\\)\n* *A Book of Ryhmes* (1829\\)\n* *The Spell:\u200a146*\n* *The Secret*\n* *Lily Hart:\u200a157*\n* *The Foundling*\n* *Albion and Marina*:\u200a129\n* *Tales of the Islanders*\n* *Tales of Angria* (written 1838\u20131839 \u2013 a collection of childhood and young adult writings including five short novels)\n\t+ Mina Laury*:\u200a119*\n\t+ Stancliffe's Hotel*:\u200a166*\n\t+ The Duke of Zamorna\n\t+ Henry Hastings\\[b]*:\u200a15,\u200a100*\n\t+ Caroline Vernon*:\u200a46*\n\t+ The Roe Head Journal Fragments*:\u200a147*\n\t+ Farewell to Angria\n\n* Mina Laury*:\u200a119*\n* Stancliffe's Hotel*:\u200a166*\n* The Duke of Zamorna\n* Henry Hastings\\[b]*:\u200a15,\u200a100*\n* Caroline Vernon*:\u200a46*\n* The Roe Head Journal Fragments*:\u200a147*\n* Farewell to Angria\n\n*The Green Dwarf, A Tale of the Perfect Tense* was written in 1833 under the pseudonym Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley. It shows the influence of Walter Scott, and Bront\u00eb's modifications to her earlier gothic style have led Christine Alexander to comment that, in the work, \"it is clear that Bront\u00eb was becoming tired of the gothic mode *per se*\".\n\n\"At the end of 1839, Bront\u00eb said goodbye to her fantasy world in a manuscript called Farewell to Angria. More and more, she was finding that she preferred to escape to her imagined worlds over remaining in reality \u2013 and she feared that she was going mad. So she said goodbye to her characters, scenes and subjects. \\[...] She wrote of the pain she felt at wrenching herself from her 'friends' and venturing into lands unknown\".\n\n### Novels\n\n* *Jane Eyre*, published in 1847\n* *Shirley*, published in 1849\n* *Villette*, published in 1853\n* *The Professor*, written before *Jane Eyre*, was first submitted together with *Wuthering Heights* by Emily Bront\u00eb and *Agnes Grey* by Anne Bront\u00eb.
