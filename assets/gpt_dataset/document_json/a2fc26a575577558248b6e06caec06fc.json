It is part of the Mid-Cities region of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington metropolitan statistical area, and is a principal city of the metropolis and region. The city had a population of 394,266 in 2020, making it the second-largest city in the county after Fort Worth and the third-largest city in the metropolitan area, after Dallas and Fort Worth. Arlington is the 50th-most populous city in the United States, the seventh-most populous city in the state of Texas, and the largest city in the state that is not a county seat.\n\nArlington is home to the University of Texas at Arlington, a major urban research university, the Arlington Assembly plant used by General Motors, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region IV, Texas Health Resources, Mensa International, and D. R. Horton. Additionally, Arlington hosts the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field, the Dallas Cowboys at AT\\&T Stadium, the Arlington Renegades at Choctaw Stadium, the Dallas Wings at College Park Center, the International Bowling Campus (which houses the United States Bowling Congress, International Bowling Museum and the International Bowling Hall of Fame), and the theme parks Six Flags Over Texas (the original Six Flags) and Hurricane Harbor.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nEuropean settlement in the Arlington area dates back at least to the 1840s. After the May 24, 1841 battle between Texas General Edward H. Tarrant and Native Americans of the Village Creek settlement, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Spring in present-day Arlington (historical marker at 32\u00b042\\.136\u2032N 97\u00b06\\.772\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff32\\.702267\u00b0N 97\\.112867\u00b0W\ufeff / 32\\.702267; -97\\.112867). The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several agriculture-related businesses were well established by the late nineteenth century.\n\nArlington was founded in 1876 along the Texas and Pacific Railway. Named after General Robert E. Lee's Arlington House in Arlington County, Virginia., Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated on April 21, 1884\\. The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a non-federal public school system.\n\nFrom 1892 until 1951, a mineral well drilled exactly in the middle of downtown Arlington, Texas, was a key reason to visit the town. The water was part of the city's brand, also serving as a meeting point for everything from prohibition to the right of women to vote. The well has been paved over.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, life in Arlington was bustling with controversy and entertainment. In the early 1920s, a tea room known as \"Top O' Hill Terrace\" opened up along the now-defunct Bankhead Highway to serve dinner and tea to guests traveling through Dallas and Fort Worth. Ownership changed in the late 1920s and shortly thereafter the facilities were secretly converted into casinos and a speakeasy. Known by historians as \"Vegas before Vegas\", escape tunnels and secret rooms were constructed to hide the illegal gambling during police raids. However, the restaurant portion of the facility still existed as a legitimate business and a front.\n\nBy 1925 the city's population was estimated at 3,031\u2014well under the population of Dallas and Fort Worth at the time. In 1929, a horse-racing track called Arlington Downs was constructed by W.T. Waggoner and Brian Nyantika close by to the speakeasy. Gambling was still illegal, but people were making bets regardless. Waggoner and his sons campaigned to make parimutuel betting legal, and in 1933 the state issued its first legal gambling permit to Arlington Downs. The track was immensely profitable at that point, making a daily average of $113,000 before inflation with a daily attendance average of 6,700 people. At the end of the 1937 season, the state legislature repealed their parimutuel gambling laws, and the Downs were sold to commercial developers.\n\nIn the 1940s, the Arlington Downs was used as a rodeo and event venue. Top O' Hill Terrace evaded the police until 1947, when famous Texas Ranger M. T. \"Lone Wolf\" Gonzaullas caught the gambling operation in full-swing and had the place shut down. The 1940s brought World War II to the forefront of the United States, and many families from around Texas moved to Arlington to find jobs. Before World War II, the city's population had grown to over 4,000\\. The war kick-started a manufacturing revolution in Texas. Arlington was between the biggest aerospace engineering hubs in Texas at the time, Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\nIn 1956, the Top O' Hill Terrace property was purchased by the Bible Baptist Seminary and converted into what is now Arlington Baptist University. The underground tunnels and original structures are still standing. In 1958, the Arlington Downs was completely destroyed by commercial developers. All that is left is an original concrete water trough and a Texas historical landmark marker placed in 2016\\. Large-scale industrialization began in 1954 with the arrival of a General Motors assembly plant. Automotive and aerospace development gave the city one of the nation's greatest population growth rates between 1950 and 1990\\.\n\nArlington became one of the \"boomburbs\", the extremely fast-growing suburbs of the post-World War II era. U.S. Census Bureau population figures for the city date the population boom: 7,692 (1950\\), 90,229 (1970\\), 261,721 (1990\\), 365,438 (2010\\) and almost 374,000 by 2011\\. Tom Vandergriff served as mayor from 1951 to 1977 during this period of robust economic development. Six Flags Over Texas opened in Arlington in 1961\\. In 1972 the Washington Senators baseball team relocated to Arlington and began play as the Texas Rangers and in 2009 the Dallas Cowboys also began to play at the newly constructed Cowboys Stadium, now AT\\&T Stadium.\n\nOn January 13, 1996, a 9-year-old girl, Amber Hagerman, was abducted in Arlington and found murdered four days later. No one has been arrested or convicted for her murder as of 2024\\. The case led to the creation of the Amber Alert system.\n\nIn October 2019, Arlington was chosen out of several major U.S. cities to become the permanent home of the $150 million National Medal of Honor Museum. Construction of the museum is set to be completed in 2024\\.\n\nGeography\n---------\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Arlington has a total area of 99\\.7 square miles (258 km2); 96\\.5 square miles (250 km2) was land, and 3\\.2 square miles (8\\.3 km2) is water. The city lies approximately 12 miles (19 km) east of downtown Fort Worth and 20 miles (32 km) west of downtown Dallas.\n\nJohnson Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River, and the Trinity River itself, flow through Arlington. Arlington borders Kennedale, Grand Prairie, Mansfield and Fort Worth, and surrounds the smaller communities of Dalworthington Gardens and Pantego.\n\n### Climate\n\nArlington falls in the Cfa (humid subtropical) region of the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system which is a climate zone characterized by hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters.\n\n* The highest recorded temperature was 113 \u00b0F (45 \u00b0C) in 1980\\.\n* The lowest recorded temperature was \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) in 1899\\.\n* The maximum average precipitation occurs in May.\n* Severe weather generally occurs April and May months.\n* Located in the famous Tornado Alley.\n* Winters are typically mild with snow seldom occurring (snowless years are not unusual).\n\n| Climate data for Arlington Six Flags, Texas (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1893\u20131894, 1991\u20132020\\) | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Month | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Year |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C) | 83(28\\) | 96(36\\) | 94(34\\) | 101(38\\) | 101(38\\) | 105(41\\) | 110(43\\) | 110(43\\) | 111(44\\) | 97(36\\) | 89(32\\) | 88(31\\) | 111(44\\) |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C) | 55\\.0(12\\.8\\) | 59\\.4(15\\.2\\) | 67\\.1(19\\.5\\) | 74\\.4(23\\.6\\) | 81\\.6(27\\.6\\) | 90\\.0(32\\.2\\) | 94\\.4(34\\.7\\) | 94\\.5(34\\.7\\) | 87\\.6(30\\.9\\) | 77\\.0(25\\.0\\) | 65\\.0(18\\.3\\) | 57\\.0(13\\.9\\) | 75\\.2(24\\.0\\) |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C) | 44\\.7(7\\.1\\) | 48\\.6(9\\.2\\) | 56\\.6(13\\.7\\) | 64\\.0(17\\.8\\) | 72\\.4(22\\.4\\) | 80\\.8(27\\.1\\) | 84\\.8(29\\.3\\) | 84\\.4(29\\.1\\) | 77\\.4(25\\.2\\) | 66\\.2(19\\.0\\) | 55\\.0(12\\.8\\) | 46\\.8(8\\.2\\) | 65\\.1(18\\.4\\) |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C) | 34\\.3(1\\.3\\) | 37\\.9(3\\.3\\) | 46\\.0(7\\.8\\) | 53\\.7(12\\.1\\) | 63\\.2(17\\.3\\) | 71\\.6(22\\.0\\) | 75\\.1(23\\.9\\) | 74\\.2(23\\.4\\) | 67\\.3(19\\.6\\) | 55\\.4(13\\.0\\) | 45\\.1(7\\.3\\) | 36\\.6(2\\.6\\) | 55\\.0(12\\.8\\) |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C) | 3(\u221216\\) | 9(\u221213\\) | 15(\u22129\\) | 31(\u22121\\) | 39(4\\) | 51(11\\) | 57(14\\) | 52(11\\) | 40(4\\) | 19(\u22127\\) | 20(\u22127\\) | 10(\u221212\\) | 3(\u221216\\) |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm) | 2\\.67(68\\) | 3\\.24(82\\) | 3\\.51(89\\) | 3\\.34(85\\) | 4\\.66(118\\) | 3\\.78(96\\) | 2\\.46(62\\) | 2\\.40(61\\) | 3\\.45(88\\) | 4\\.82(122\\) | 2\\.76(70\\) | 3\\.00(76\\) | 40\\.09(1,018\\) |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm) | 0\\.1(0\\.25\\) | 0\\.4(1\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.0(0\\.0\\) | 0\\.3(0\\.76\\) | 0\\.8(2\\.0\\) |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0\\.01 in) | 5\\.4 | 6\\.5 | 7\\.6 | 6\\.3 | 8\\.2 | 7\\.5 | 4\\.7 | 4\\.8 | 5\\.8 | 6\\.0 | 5\\.6 | 5\\.5 | 73\\.9 |\n| Average snowy days (\u2265 0\\.1 in) | 0\\.2 | 0\\.2 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.0 | 0\\.1 | 0\\.5 |\n| Source: NOAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\nDuring the April 3, 2012 tornado outbreak, a severe thunderstorm produced an EF2 tornado in Eastern Kennedale which moved northeast across 287 near Stagetrail Drive and continued in a North North-Eastern direction.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Arlington became the first city since 1944 to hold every World Series game in a single venue at Globe Life Field. In October 2023, the Rangers defeated the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series, and won the 2023 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys football team moved from Texas Stadium in Irving in 2009 to the $1\\.3 billion AT\\&T Stadium, which is within walking distance of the Rangers Ballpark. Completed in 2009, it has attracted high-profile sporting events to Arlington, including the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, Super Bowl XLV in 2011, the 2013 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball South Regional Championships, and the 2014 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Final Four; the stadium was also the site of the first College Football Championship Game in January 2015 (covering the 2014 season). The Dallas Cowboys rent AT\\&T Stadium from the City of Arlington for $167,500 per month over a thirty-year period, a sum far less than market value; in exchange, the Cowboys have complete control over the facility's calendar and the revenues collected therefrom, including naming rights, billboard advertising, concession sales and most of the surrounding parking.\n\nThe Dallas Wings became the first Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) franchise in North Texas in 2015\\. They were known as the Tulsa Shock while based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but reinvented their brand after relocating to North Texas. The Wings play home games at the College Park Center in Arlington.\n\nThe Arlington Renegades is a UFL football team based in Arlington. The team was established in 2019 and played in the renovated Choctaw Stadium. The inaugural home opener drew 17,026 fans.\n\nThe North Texas SC of MLS Next Pro also calls Arlington and Choctaw Stadium home since May 2020\\.\n\nAT\\&T Stadium will host the most matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\n### College sports\n\nThe UT Arlington Mavericks are the athletic teams representing The University of Texas at Arlington. The Mavericks compete in the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference in 15 varsity sports.\n\nUTA was a founding member of the Southland Conference in 1963 and participated in the league until the end of the 2011\u201312 athletic year. They joined the Western Athletic Conference for one year before moving to the Sun Belt Conference for several years then moving back to the Western Athletic Conference in July 2022\\.\n\nA new arena called the College Park Center is now the host facility for basketball and volleyball home games as well as other university activities. The arena opened February 1, 2012, and seats approximately 7,000 people. Baseball home games are held at the Clay Gould Ballpark and softball home games are at the Allan Saxe Field; both facilities completed $5\\.5 million in upgrade cost in early 2015\\.\n\nThe Mavericks' team name selection was made in 1971, predating the National Basketball Association's expansion franchise Dallas Mavericks' starting choice in 1980\\.\n\nArlington Baptist College also competes in a number of sports. They are known as the Patriots and is an active member in the National Christian College Athletic Association, Southwest Region, Division II, and is a member of the Association of Christian College Athletics. The sports Arlington Baptist competes in range from: basketball (men and women's), golf (men and women's), cross country (men and women's), Track \\& Field (men), volleyball (women), softball (women), and baseball (men).\n\n### Arlington athletes\n\nArlington is the home of several notable athletes. 1998 American League Rookie of the Year Ben Grieve graduated from Martin High School in 1994\\. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim outfielder Vernon Wells grew up in Arlington and attended Bowie High School, San Francisco Giants outfielder Hunter Pence attended Arlington High School and played collegiate baseball at The University of Texas at Arlington, and St. Louis Cardinals pitcher John Lackey also played for UTA. Lamar High School alumnus Jeremy Wariner won two gold medals in the 2004 Athens Olympics, and the 2005 world championship in the 400 meters in Rome. UTA also produced Doug Russell, who won two gold medals in swimming at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968 and for whom a park on campus is named. Champion bodybuilder (Mr. Olympia 1998\u20132005\\) Ronnie Coleman resides in Arlington. Houston Comets Guard Erin Grant grew up in Arlington and attended Mansfield high school.

While it is one of the oldest Ecological Services Field Stations in the United States, today its activities are focused primarily on the illegal trafficking of exotic species through Dallas/Fort-Worth International Airport. The office is not staffed or funded for nor active on the protection and enhancement of local urban-area endangered species habitat, nor on the enforcement of the related provisions of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) operates the Arlington Main Post Office. Other post offices operated by the USPS include Bardin Road, East Arlington, Great Southwest, Oakwood, Pantego, and Watson Community.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board operates the Arlington Aviation field office in Arlington.\n\nEducation\n---------\n\n### Colleges and universities\n\nArlington is home to several public and private colleges and universities.\n\nThe University of Texas at Arlington (UTA or UT Arlington) is one of the largest universities in North Texas. The university has over 40,000 students and is a valuable asset to the city of Arlington and its economy. Buildings within the academic core of the UT Arlington campus are among the oldest structures in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, including Preston Hall, Ransom Hall, College Hall, and the original Arlington High School.\n\nThe Southeast Campus of Tarrant County College is located in Arlington.\n\nArlington Baptist University (ABU) is a private 4-year Bible college affiliated with the World Baptist Fellowship that offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. ABU traces its founding to J. Frank Norris, the controversial Independent Baptist minister.\n\nA branch of University of Phoenix is located in Arlington, as well as the flagship campus of Ogle School, a cosmetology school.\n\n### Primary and secondary schools\n\nArlington's residents live in five independent school districts (or ISDs): Arlington ISD, Mansfield ISD, Hurst-Euless-Bedford ISD, Kennedale ISD, and Fort Worth ISD. In Texas, school district boundaries do not always follow city and county boundaries because all aspects of school district government apparatus, including district boundaries, are separated from city and county governments. Not all city of Arlington residents is in the AISD, and not all AISD students are residents of Arlington.\n\nThere are currently ten AISD high schools.\n\nArlington has dozens of private and public charter schools not affiliated with any ISDs.\n\nTransportation\n--------------\n\nOn July 2, 1902, the first Dallas/Fort-Worth \"Interurban\" electric trolley came to Arlington; this popular service ran between those three cities and points in between until Christmas Eve, 1934, providing easy transportation for both business and pleasure. The track ran through Arlington along what is now Abram Street.\n\nIn the era of private operation of passenger trains prior to the Amtrak era, Texas and Pacific Railway trains such as the *Texas Eagle* and the *Louisiana Eagle* made stops in Arlington, on trips between Fort Worth and Dallas. Amtrak's *Texas Eagle* (Chicago-San Antonio) makes stops at Fort Worth Central Station 14 miles to the west and Dallas Union Station 18 miles to the east.\n\nArlington Municipal Airport (GKY) is located entirely within Arlington and is a public use airport owned by the City of Arlington. It serves as a reliever airport for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field. Several companies operate aircraft services on the airport property, including the Bell Helicopter division of Textron.\n\nFor many years, Arlington had the infamous distinction of being the largest city in the United States that was not served by a public transportation system. Between 1980 and 2013, voters rejected three separate ballot proposals to bring public transportation to the city, though certain political and economic realities particular to North Texas made successful passage of those measures arguably more difficult in Arlington than in other parts of the state or country. On August 19, 2013, the two-year pilot project known as the Metro Arlington Xpress (MAX) bus began offering weekday bus service between College Park Center (on the campus of The University of Texas at Arlington) and the Trinity Railway Express (TRE) CentrePort Station near DFW Airport, with a single stop near the Arlington Entertainment District. From the TRE station, riders could take the TRE to Fort Worth, Dallas and points in between, all of which are served by comprehensive public transit systems. On its first year, the MAX program logged 64,600 one-way rides and cost $1\\.4 million. The service was run through a tri-party agreement between the City of Arlington, the Fort Worth Transportation Authority and the Dallas Area Rapid Transit. City Council extended the MAX bus service beyond the original two-year pilot timeframe through annual contracts until December 31, 2017\\. The MAX was officially shut down on December 29, 2017, a few weeks after Via debuted in Arlington. The City of Arlington has a lower than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, just 4\\.7 percent of Arlington households lacked a car, which dropped to 3\\.7 percent in 2016\\. The national average is 8\\.7 percent in 2016\\. Arlington averaged 1\\.89 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1\\.8\\.\n\nIn January 2017, Arlington was part of a Texas state-wide designation as an Automated Vehicle Proving Ground by the U.S. Department of Transportation. In August 2017, Arlington launched the first autonomous vehicle shuttle service in the United States offered by a municipal government to the general public on a continuous basis. Named Milo, the autonomous electric shuttles provide service during major events at Globe Life Park and AT\\&T Stadium, connecting remote parking areas to the stadiums.\n\nArlington also offers Via Arlington, a public, on-demand, shared transportation service in partnership with the TransitTech company Via, which began in December 2017\\. Riders can request a pickup from a six-passenger van within a designated service area, which covers key destinations within Arlington as well as connecting to the Trinity Railway Express CentrePort Station. Beginning January 19, 2021, this service was expanded citywide. Arlington also partners with Via and autonomous vehicles provider May Mobility to operate Arlington RAPID, which provides on-demand autonomous vehicle rides in Downtown Arlington and on the University of Texas at Arlington's campus and is one of the first services of its kind in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, Arlington has four transit services targeting individual demographic groups: \"Handitran\" serves senior citizens and disabled people; Arlington hotels pay for a tourist-oriented shuttle-bus system for their guests; The University of Texas at Arlington runs a limited shuttle service for college students; and lastly Mission Arlington, an Arlington-run charity serving the severely indigent, has a bus service that circulates people needing social services or transportation to employment.\n\nThe city is served by two Interstate Highways, I-20, also known as Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway, and I-30, also named Tom Landry Memorial Highway. Other limited-access freeways include State Highway 360, which is named for the founder of Six Flags Over Texas, Angus G. Wynne, running along the eastern border, and U.S. Highway 287, which traverses the southwestern portion of the city. In most cases, the memorial names are not used in reference to these roadways.\nThe city also has a tollway, The 360 Tollway, which connects Mansfield to Arlington and Grand Prairie. The tollway is also known as the Rosa Parks Memorial Parkway, named after the civil rights activist. Near US-287, where the tollway ends, the tollway is also named \"Senator Chris Harris Memorial Highway\" after the local legislator who aided the extension.\n\nThe Union Pacific Railroad now owns and operates the original Texas and Pacific (later Missouri Pacific) transcontinental right-of-way and rail route through Arlington (parallel to which the Interurban originally ran); it offers no passenger stops in Arlington, its Arlington freight service is primarily to the local General Motors assembly plant, and most of its lengthy and numerous freight trains are merely passing through town to and from points far away.\n\nNotable people\n--------------\n\nNotes\n-----", "chunks": [{"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Arlington,_Texas_0", "original_index": 0, "content": "| Arlington | |\n| --- | --- |\n| City | |\n| AT\\&T StadiumOil Derrick Tower at Six Flags Over TexasArlington Hall at UT ArlingtonGlobe Life FieldArlington Chamber of Commerce | |\n| FlagLogo | |\n| Nicknames: The Agg | |\n| Motto: The American Dream City | |\n| Show ArlingtonShow Tarrant CountyShow TexasShow the United States | |\n| ArlingtonArlingtonLocation within TexasShow map of TexasArlingtonArlingtonLocation within the United StatesShow map of the United StatesArlingtonArlingtonArlington (North America)Show map of North America | |\n| Coordinates: 32\u00b042\u203218\u2033N 97\u00b007\u203222\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff32\\.70500\u00b0N 97\\.12278\u00b0W\ufeff / 32\\.70500; -97\\.12278 | |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | Texas |\n| County | Tarrant |\n| Founded | 1876; 148 years ago (1876) |\n| Named for | Arlington House |\n| Government | |\n| \u2022 Type | Council\u2013Manager |\n| \u2022 Mayor | Jim Ross |\n| \u2022 City Manager | Trey Yelverton |\n| Area | |\n| \u2022 Total | 99\\.44 sq mi (257\\.54 km2) |\n| \u2022 Land | 95\\.84 sq mi (248\\.22 km2) |", "contextualized_text": "The chunk provides key introductory information about the city of Arlington, Texas, including its geographical location, governmental structure, founding year, and area statistics, serving as a foundational overview within the larger document that covers Arlington's history, demographics, economy, culture, and government."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Arlington,_Texas_1", "original_index": 1, "content": "| Area | |\n| \u2022 Total | 99\\.44 sq mi (257\\.54 km2) |\n| \u2022 Land | 95\\.84 sq mi (248\\.22 km2) |\n| \u2022 Water | 3\\.60 sq mi (9\\.32 km2) |\n| Elevation | 604 ft (184 m) |\n| Population (2020\\) | |\n| \u2022 Total | 394,266 |\n| \u2022 Rank | 50th in the United States7th in Texas |\n| \u2022 Density | 4,113\\.79/sq mi (1,588\\.37/km2) |\n| Demonym | Arlingtonian |\n| Time zone | UTC\u22126 (CST) |\n| \u2022 Summer (DST) | UTC\u22125 (CDT) |\n| ZIP Codes | 76001-76007, 76010-76018, 76094, 76096 |\n| Area codes | 682,817, 214, 469, 945, 972 |\n| FIPS code | 48-04000 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 2409731 |\n| Website | www.arlingtontx.gov |", "contextualized_text": "This chunk provides critical statistical and geographical information about Arlington, Texas, including its total area, population density, elevation, and administrative details such as ZIP codes and area codes.

The well has been paved over.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, life in Arlington was bustling with controversy and entertainment. In the early 1920s, a tea room known as \"Top O' Hill Terrace\" opened up along the now-defunct Bankhead Highway to serve dinner and tea to guests traveling through Dallas and Fort Worth. Ownership changed in the late 1920s and shortly thereafter the facilities were secretly converted into casinos and a speakeasy.
