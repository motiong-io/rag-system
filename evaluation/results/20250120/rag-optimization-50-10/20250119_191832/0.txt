        Who is the 15th first lady of the United States?:
The 15th President of the United States was James Buchanan, and he was a bachelor, so he did not have a wife to serve as First Lady. Instead, his niece, Harriet Lane Johnston, acted as the First Lady of the United States during his presidency, from 1857 to 1861.

What is the name of Harriet Lane Johnston's mother?:
Jane Ann Buchanan Lane.

Who is the second assassinated president of the United States?:
The second American president to be assassinated was Abraham Lincoln. He was shot by John Wilkes Booth on the night of April 14, 1865, and died the following morning.

What is the maiden name of the second assassinated president's mother?:
The second assassinated president was Abraham Lincoln's predecessor in being assassinated, but not the second president to die in office. The second president to die in office was Zachary Taylor's predecessor in death, but not by assassination. The second president to die by assassination was Abraham Lincoln, and his mother's maiden name was Nancy Hanks.
