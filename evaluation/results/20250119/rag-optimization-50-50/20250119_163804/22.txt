Generated answer: According to the 2020 United States census, the cities in Oklahoma with at least 100,000 residents are:

1. Oklahoma City - population: 681,054
2. Tulsa - population: 403,090 (Note: Not exactly 403,090 for the city of Tulsa proper but close enough for this example)
3. Norman - population: 128,026 (Note: Not exactly over 100,000 but close enough)

Now let's find their populations according to the 1990 United States census:

1. **Oklahoma City - population**: 444,719
2. **Tulsa - population**: 367,302
3. **Norman - population**: 80,071 (Below the threshold of this problem but added for completeness)

Total population of these cities in Oklahoma according to the 1990 census is:
444,719 + 367,302 = 812,021

Adding Norman even though below threshold:
812,021 + 80,071 = 892,092

Check result: N
