        What is the name of the longest river in British Columbia that only flows within the province and does not enter any other province or territory?:
The Fraser River

Who is the person that the Fraser River is named after?:
The Fraser River is named after Simon Fraser, a Canadian explorer and fur trader who led an expedition on behalf of the North West Company in 1808.

What is the birth year of Simon Fraser?:
The birth year of Simon Fraser is 1776.

What is the founding year of Harvard University?:
The founding year of Harvard University is 1636.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to find out the age of Harvard University when Simon Fraser was born. 

The founding year of Harvard University is 1636, and Simon Fraser was born in 1776. 

So, to find the age of Harvard University when Simon Fraser was born, we subtract the founding year from the birth year: 1776 - 1636 = 140.

Therefore, Harvard University was 140 years old when Simon Fraser, the person after whom the Fraser River (the longest river in British Columbia that only flows within the province) is named, was born.
