The **Big 12 Conference** is a college athletic conference headquartered in Irving, Texas. It consists of 16 full-member universities (3 private universities and 13 public universities) in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.

The Big 12 is a member of the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for all sports. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition.

The Big 12 is one of the Power Four conferences, the four highest-earning and most historically successful FBS football conferences. Power Four conferences are guaranteed at least one bid to a New Year's Six bowl game and have been granted exemptions from certain NCAA rules.

The Big 12 is a 501(c)(3\) nonprofit organization. Brett Yormark became the commissioner on August 1, 2022\.

The Big 12 was founded in February 1994\. All eight members of the former Big Eight Conference joined with half the members of the former Southwest Conference (Texas, Texas A\&M, Baylor and Texas Tech) to form the conference, with play beginning in 1996\.

Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah joined the conference on August 2, 2024, as part of a more extensive NCAA conference realignment.

History
-------

The Big 12 Conference was founded in February 1994\. All eight members of the former Big Eight Conference joined with half the members of the former Southwest Conference (Texas, Texas A\&M, Baylor and Texas Tech) to form the conference, with play beginning in 1996\.

The Big 12 does not claim the Big Eight's history as its own, even though it was essentially the Big Eight plus four of the Texas universities.

The Big 12 began athletic play in fall 1996, with the Texas Tech vs. Kansas State football game being the first-ever sports event staged by the conference.

From its formation until 2011, its 12 members competed in two divisions in most sports. The two Oklahoma universities and the four Texas universities formed the South Division, while the other six universities of the former Big Eight formed the North Division.

Between 2011 and 2012 four charter members left the conference:

* Colorado
* Missouri
* Nebraska
* Texas A\&M

In 2012, two universities joined the conference:

* TCU
* West Virginia

On July 26, 2021, Oklahoma and Texas notified the Big 12 Conference that the two universities did not wish to extend their grant of television rights beyond the 2024–25 athletic year. On July 27, 2021, Oklahoma and Texas sent a joint letter to the Southeastern Conference requesting an invitation for membership beginning July 1, 2025\. On July 29, 2021, the 14 presidents and chancellors of SEC member universities voted unanimously to invite Oklahoma and Texas to join the SEC. The following day, the Texas Board of Regents and Oklahoma Board of Regents each accepted the invitation to join the SEC from July 1, 2025\.

On September 10, 2021, the Big 12 announced that invitations had been extended to and accepted by BYU (a football independent and member of the non-football West Coast Conference) and three members of the American Athletic Conference in Cincinnati, UCF, and Houston. These moves, combined with the impending departure of Oklahoma and Texas, would once again increase the Big 12's membership to twelve schools. All four schools began competing in Big 12 athletics beginning in summer of 2023\. BYU had initially announced that it would join in 2023, and Houston indicated it could do so as well. On June 10, 2022, The American and its three departing members announced a buyout agreement that allowed those schools to join the Big 12 in 2023\.

On February 9, 2023, Oklahoma and Texas announced they had reached a settlement with the conference that allowed them to join the SEC on July 1, 2024\.

On July 27, 2023, Colorado, a former member of the Big 12, announced it would rejoin the conference from the Pac-12 beginning in the 2024–25 academic year. The following week, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah announced they would leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, also effective for the 2024–25 academic year.

Although West Virginia University is based out of Morgantown, West Virginia (officially part of the Pittsburgh (26th) media market), the TV market encompasses the majority of West Virginia's TV viewership and also reaches well into Western Pennsylvania.

Kansas State University is in Manhattan, Kansas, which is part of the Topeka, Kansas media market, but it is close to the Wichita market, which encompasses two-thirds of the state (stretching to the border with Colorado), including the cities of Dodge City, Garden City, Hutchinson and Salina.

While the University of Kansas is in Lawrence, Kansas, it has close proximity to the Kansas City television market, increasing the base into western Missouri.

### Grant of Rights

Member universities granted their first and second tier sports media rights to the conference for the length of their current TV deals. The Grant of Rights (GOR) deal with the leagues' TV contracts ensures that "if a Big 12 school leaves for another league in the next 13 years, that school's media rights, including revenue, would remain with the Big 12 and not its new conference".

GOR is seen by league members as a "foundation of stability" and allowed the Big 12 to be "positioned with one of the best media rights arrangements in collegiate sports, providing the conference and its members unprecedented revenue growth, and sports programming over two networks." All members agreed to the GOR and later agreed to extend the initial 6-year deal to 13 years to correspond to the length of their TV contracts.

Prior to this agreement, the Big Ten and Pac-12 also had similar GOR agreements. The Big 12 subsequently assisted the ACC in drafting its GOR agreement. Three of the four major conferences now have such agreements, with the SEC the only exception.

### Tier 3 events

The Big 12 is the only major conference that allows members to monetize TV rights for tier 3 events in football and men's basketball. This allows individual Big 12 member institutions to create tier 3 deals that include TV rights for one home football game and four home men's basketball games per season. Tier 3 rights exist for other sports as well, but these are not unique to the Big 12\. The unique arrangement potentially allows Big 12 members to remain some of college sports' highest revenue earners. Other conferences' cable deals are subject to value reductions based on how people acquire cable programming; Big 12 universities' tier 3 deals are exempt. Texas alone earned more than $150 million of that total from their Longhorn Network before it was shut down with its move to the SEC.

As of 2022, all of the Big 12's tier 3 rights are held by ESPN; it bought the tier 3 rights to most Big 12 teams (besides Oklahoma) in 2019, moving the events exclusively to ESPN\+. The Oklahoma Sooners retained an agreement with Bally Sports Oklahoma (which distributed its football game via pay-per-view) until 2022, when it also sold its rights to ESPN\+. Prior to its departure to the SEC, ESPN also ran a dedicated cable network for the Texas Longhorns known as Longhorn Network, as a joint venture between the university and Learfield.

### Business partnerships and innovation

The Big 12 has a sponsorship rights partnership with Learfield IMG College. The Big 12 announced on September 9, 2022, that it appointed WME Sports and IMG Media, Endeavor companies, to facilitate its global content and commercial strategy. Commissioner Brett Yormark stated "We have aligned with a best-in-class team to build a best-in-class business strategy for the Conference". November 14, 2022 Big 12 formed a comprehensive business advisor board composed of over three dozen entrepreneurial icons and respective industry leaders. From the likes of Monte Lipman the Founder/CEO Republic Records, Steve Stoute Founder/CEO UnitedMasters \& Translation, Mark Shapiro President of Endeavor, Gary Vaynerchuk’s VaynerMedia, singer Garth Brooks, NBA legend Jason Kidd, Keith Sheldon President of Entertainment for Hard Rock Cafe International, and Ross Levinsohn Chairman and CEO - The Arena Group \& Sports Illustrated.

The Big 12 partnered with creative agency Translation to help build a more contemporary audience and brand.
Soon after Big 12 Conference made a deal with A Bathing Ape (BAPE) for Championship games. The Conference and BAPE worked together to create limited-edition clothing and a camouflaged Big 12 logo throughout the stadium, arena, and uniforms.

The Big 12 has 11 official corporate partners: Allstate, Children’s Health, Dr Pepper, Gatorade, Grand Caliber, Old Trapper, On Location, Phillips 66, Sonic Hard Seltzer, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Tickets For Less. There are dozens of other companies engaged as sponsors of the conference.

On March 15, 2023, before the NFL Draft, the Big 12 announced the first of its kind across all college conferences, being a conference-wide Pro Day. Instead of schools hosting separate pro days for their football players, there will be only one conference-wide scouting event before the 2024 NFL draft. The event will be held at the Dallas Cowboys training complex, Ford Center at The Star. What essentially would be a conference version of the NFL combine, the Pro Day would be televised on NFL Network.

In March, the Big 12 Conference announced a partnership with the legendary Rucker Park for a community engagement event. In June the event was officially announced as "Big 12 Hoops in the Park", to host men's and women's summer exhibition games. Throughout the event, the Big 12 is also preparing a number of entertainment activities and community engagements. The activities include youth clinics, meet-and-greets, live music, and food.

Early June 2023, the "Big 12 Mexico" was announced, which will include men's and women's soccer, baseball, basketball, and football games and an international media rights strategy. The Big 12 Mexico will debut in December 2024 with men's and women's basketball games between Kansas and Houston at the Arena CDMX in Mexico City. The Big 12 will also consider hosting a football bowl game in Monterrey beginning in 2026\. This would be the first-ever bowl game in Mexico.

Conference revenue comes mostly from television contracts, bowl games, the NCAA, merchandise, licensing and conference-hosted sporting events. The Conference distributes revenue annually to member institutions. From 1996 to 2011, 57 percent of revenue was allotted equally; while 43 percent was based upon the number of football and men's basketball television appearances and other factors. In 2011, the distribution was 76 percent equal and 24 percent based on television appearances. Changing the arrangement requires a unanimous vote; as a Big 12 member, Nebraska and Texas A\&M had withheld support for more equitable revenue distribution.

With this model, larger universities can receive more revenue because they appear more often on television. In 2006, for example, Texas received $10\.2 million, 44% more than Baylor University's $7\.1 million.

Big 12 revenue was generally less than other BCS conferences; this was due in part to television contracts signed with Fox Sports Net (four years for $48 million) and ABC/ESPN (eight years for $480 million).

In 2011, the Big 12 announced a new 13-year media rights deal with Fox that would ensure that every Big 12 home football game is televised, as well as greatly increasing coverage of women's basketball, conference championships and other sports. The deal, valued at an estimated $1\.1 billion, runs until 2025\. In 2012, the conference announced a new agreement with Fox and ESPN, replacing the current ABC/ESPN deal, to immediately increase national media broadcasts of football and increase conference revenue; the new deal was estimated to be worth $2\.6 billion through the 2025 expiration. The two deals pushed the conference per-university payout to approximately $20 million per year, while separating third-tier media rights into separate deals for each university; such contracts secured an additional $6 million to $20 million per university annually. The per-university payout under the deal is expected to reach $44 million, according to Commissioner Bob Bowlsby.

In 2022, the conference renewed its media rights with ESPN and Fox Sports for six seasons starting in 2025–26, with an estimated US$380 million average annual fee.

### National championships

The following is a list of all NCAA, equestrian, and college football championships won by teams that were representing the Big 12 Conference in NCAA-recognized sports at the time of their championship. The most recent Big 12 team to win a national title is BYU men's cross country in 2024, along with being the most recent team to win a national title while representing the Big 12\. Only two years of the Big 12's existence has the conference not won at least one team National Title, 2007 and 2020\. However, in 2020 multiple National Championships were not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

One former member of the conference did not win a National Championship while a member of the Big 12, Missouri. Original members Kansas State and Iowa State have not won a championship while representing the Big 12\. The only national championships won by 2012 arrivals TCU and West Virginia since joining the Big 12 have been in rifle, a sport that the conference has never sponsored.

### Conference champions

The Conference sponsors 23 sports, 10 men's and 13 women's.

In football, divisional titles were awarded based on regular-season conference results, with the teams with the best conference records from the North and South playing in the Big 12 Championship Game from 1996 to 2010\. Baseball, basketball, softball, tennis and women's soccer titles are awarded in both regular-season and tournament play. Cross country, golf, gymnastics, swimming and diving, track and field, and wrestling titles are awarded during an annual meet of participating teams. The volleyball title is awarded based on regular-season play.

Football
--------

The first football game in conference play was Texas Tech vs. Kansas State in 1996, won by Kansas State, 21–14\.

From 1996 to 2010, Big 12 Conference teams played eight conference games a season. Each team faced all five opponents within its own division and three teams from the opposite division. Inter-divisional play was a "three-on, three-off" system, where teams would play three teams from the other division on a home-and-home basis for two seasons, and then play the other three foes from the opposite side for a two-year home-and-home.

This format came under considerable criticism, especially from Nebraska and Oklahoma, who were denied a yearly match between two of college football's most storied programs.\[*citation needed*] The Nebraska-Oklahoma rivalry was one of the most intense in college football history.\[*citation needed*] (Until 2006, the teams had never met in the Big 12 Championship.) Due to the departure of Nebraska and Colorado in 2011, the Big 12 eliminated the divisions (and championship game) and instituted a nine-game round-robin format.\[*citation needed*] With the advent of the College Football Playoff committee looking at teams' strength of schedule for picking the four playoff teams, on December 8, 2015, the Big 12 announced an annual requirement for all Big 12 teams to schedule a non-conference game against a team from the four other Power Five conferences (plus Notre Dame). Per Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby: "Schedule strength is a key component in CFP Selection Committee deliberations. This move will strengthen the resumes for all Big 12 teams. Coupled with the nine-game full round robin Conference schedule our teams play, it will not only benefit the teams at the top of our standings each season, but will impact the overall strength of the Conference." The Big 12 has made it to the Playoffs 6 times from 2014 to 2023\. Three Big 12 participants have made it to the playoff: Oklahoma in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019; Texas in 2023; and TCU in 2022\.

### Championship game

The Big 12 Championship Game game was approved by all members except Nebraska. It was held each year, commencing with the first match in the 1996 season at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis. It pitted the division champions against each other after the regular season was completed.

Following the 2008 game, the event was moved to the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, being played there in 2009 and 2010\. In 2010, the Sooners defeated the Cornhuskers 23–20\.

After 2010, the game was moved to Arlington for 2011, 2012, and 2013\. However, the decision became moot following the 2010 season because the league lacked sufficient members.

In April 2015, the ACC and the Big 12 developed new rules for the NCAA to deregulate conference championship games. The measure passed on January 14, 2016, allowing a conference with fewer than 12 teams to stage a championship game that does not count against the FBS limit of 12 regular-season games under either of the following circumstances:

* The game involves the top two teams following a full round-robin conference schedule.
* The game involves two divisional winners, each having played a full round-robin schedule in its division.

Under the first criterion, the Big 12 championship game resumed at the conclusion of the 2017 regular season, and is played during the first weekend of December, the time all other FBS conference championship games are played.

### Bowl affiliations

The following were bowl games for the Big 12 for the 2022 season.\[*needs update*]

| Pick | Name | Location | Opposing conference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| – | College Football Playoff | – | – |
| 1 | Sugar Bowl† | New Orleans, Louisiana | SEC |
| 2 | Alamo Bowl | San Antonio, Texas | Pac-12 |
| 3 | Cheez-It Bowl | Orlando, Florida | ACC |
| 4 | Texas Bowl | Houston, Texas | SEC |
| 5 | Liberty Bowl | Memphis, Tennessee | SEC |
| 6 | Guaranteed Rate Bowl | Phoenix, Arizona | Big Ten |
| 7‡ | Armed Forces Bowl | Fort Worth, Texas | AAC/C-USA |
| 7‡ | First Responder Bowl | Dallas, Texas | AAC/ACC/C-USA |
| †The Big 12 champion will go to the Sugar Bowl unless selected for the College Football Playoff. In the event that the conference champion is selected for the playoff, the conference runner-up will go to the Sugar Bowl. In years in which the Sugar Bowl is a CFP semifinal, the Big 12 champion (runner-up if the champion is selected for the CFP) is slotted to the Cotton, Fiesta or Peach Bowls. ‡The seventh selection is a "flex pick." | | | |

Rivalries
---------

The Big 12 is known for rivalries (primarily in football) that mostly predate the conference. The Kansas-Missouri rivalry was the longest running, the longest west of the Mississippi, and the second longest in college football, dating back to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association before evolving into the Big Eight. It was played 119 times before Missouri left the Big 12\. As of October 2012, the University of Kansas' athletic department had not accepted Missouri's invitations to play inter-conference rivalry games, putting the rivalry on hold. Sports clubs sponsored by the two universities continued to play each other. Kansas and Missouri renewed the rivalry in men's basketball starting in December 2021, and have announced that they will meet again in football in 2025\.

The rivalry between TCU and Baylor, known as the Revivalry is also one of the longest running in college football, with the two universities having played each other — largely as Southwest Conference members — 120 times since 1899\. Following the 2024 game, TCU leads the series 59–54–7\.

Some of the football rivalries between Big 12 universities include:

| Rivalry | Name | Trophy | Gamesplayed† | Began | Record |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arizona–Arizona State | Duel in the Desert | Territorial Cup | 98 | 1899 | Arizona 51–45–1 |
| Baylor–Houston |  |  | 30 | 1950 | Baylor 15–14–1 |
| Baylor–TCU | The Bluebonnet Battle |  | 120 | 1899 | TCU 59–54–7 |
| Baylor–Texas Tech | Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Shootout |  | 83 | 1929 | Baylor 42–40–1 |
| BYU–Utah | Holy War | Beehive Boot | 102 | 1896 | Utah 62–36–4 |

Men's Basketball
----------------

As of the end of the 2023-2024 season, nine current Big 12 members are among the teams with the most wins and/or the highest win percentage in NCAA Division 1 men's basketball: Kansas (\#2 in wins, \#3 in percentage), Cincinnati (\#12 wins, \#19 percentage), Utah (\#15 wins, \#22 percentage), BYU (\#17 wins, \#31 percentage), Arizona (\#19 wins, \#10 percentage), West Virginia (\#20 wins, \#36 percentage), Houston (\#37 percentage), Oklahoma State (\#39 wins), and Kansas State (\#42 wins). On the list of the most Final Four appearances, Kansas is \#5 and Cincinnati, Houston, and Oklahoma State are all tied (with several other schools) at \#11\.

From 1996 to 2011, standings in conference play were not split among divisions, although the schedule was structured as if they were. Teams played a home-and-home against teams within their divisions and a single game against teams from the opposite division for a total of 16 conference games. After Nebraska and Colorado left, Big 12 play transitioned to an 18-game, double round robin schedule. When the conference temporarily expanded to 14 members for the 2023–24 season, the 18-game schedule remained, but the double round-robin was discontinued in favor of a new scheduling formula.

Starting in 2024–25, the Big 12 will go to a 20-game schedule. Each team will face five opponents at home, five opponents on the road, and five opponents both home and away.

Broadcasting and media rights
-----------------------------

The Big 12's media rights are controlled primarily by ESPN (ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, and ESPN\+) and Fox Sports (Fox and FS1\). Since 2012, ESPN has sublicensed college basketball games to CBS Sports. Beginning in 2025, ESPN will sublicense college football and basketball games to TNT Sports.

### 2012 media deal

On September 7, 2012, the Big 12 announced a 13-year agreement with ESPN and Fox valued at $2\.6 billion in total. ESPN and Fox split college football rights, while the basketball inventory was held by ESPN with sublicensing options for CBS Sports and Fox Sports. The agreement also included a grant of rights for all current Big 12 teams over the period of the contract.

In addition to the national agreement, each Big 12 university maintained the right to sell its "third-tier" covering selected events per-season (including one football game, basketball games, and other events outside of those sports). The third-tier rights to the Texas Longhorns are held through a channel dedicated to the team — Longhorn Network — which is operated by ESPN. In 2019, ESPN announced that it would acquire the third-tier rights to all Big 12 teams through 2024–25 (excluding Oklahoma and Texas, which are still under long-term contracts with ESPN\+ and Longhorn Network respectively), and place their content on its subscription streaming service ESPN\+. ESPN also acquired exclusive rights to all future Big 12 football championship games, replacing the previous alternation between ESPN and Fox.

### 2025 extension deal

On October 30, 2022, the Big 12 announced that it had reached early broadcast deal to renew rights with ESPN network (includes ABC rights) and Fox. It is a six-year media rights agreement worth a total of $2\.3 billion, but also reportedly includes an "escalator clause" that will raise the value of the contracts if only Power Five schools are added. By striking a deal prior to the exclusive negotiating window with ESPN and Fox, the Big 12 managed to achieve several of its primary objectives of stability and security, including the ability to consult its member schools to seek an extended grant of rights and potential future conference expansion. Fox's deal also places a slate of Big 12 college basketball games on Fox Sports for the first time.
