        What are the dates of the blue moons that occurred between the beginning of World War I (July 28, 1914) and the end of World War II (September 2, 1945)?:
Based on the provided contexts, the dates of blue moons between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945, can be determined as follows:

1. 1915 (Pruett's definition): 
- January 31 
- August 31 (Pruett's), 
- March 31 (seasonal), 
- August 31 (astro-seasonal)

2. 1934 (seasonal, Pruett's, and Maine rules): 
- May 31 (Maine), 
- June 30 (Pruett's), 
- October 31 (seasonal)

3. August 1945: This date may refer to a full moon on August 21; however, according to Trefethen, this could be considered a "blue moon" using the apparent sun.

These dates are derived from information about the blue moon occurrences mentioned in the contexts. It should be noted that these dates may not be comprehensive or definitive. For an exhaustive list, it is recommended to consult the original *Maine Farmers' Almanac* or perform additional research using astronomical resources.

Which of the blue moons identified between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945, occurred on the 31st of the month?:
According to the text, one case where Trefethen appears to have used the apparent rather than mean sun was in August 1945, but the specific date is not mentioned. However, based on the general information provided, we can deduce that:

* A blue moon occurred in August 1943, but the date is not specified.
* Another blue moon occurred in 1915, but the specific dates are not provided.
* The Maine Farmers' Almanac mentions a blue moon in August 1938 and October 1944, but these dates do not coincide with the 31st of the month.

However, one of the Pruett blue moons mentioned occurred on October 31, 1944.

How many of the blue moons that occurred on January 31, August 31 (Pruett's), March 31 (seasonal), August 31 (astro-seasonal), May 31 (Maine), June 30 (Pruett's), October 31 (seasonal) occurred on the 31st of the month using the Pruett rule?:
According to the text, two of the dates mentioned occurred on the 31st of the month using Pruett's rule: January 31 and June 30 (although June only has 30 days, so it's actually June 30), and August 31. 

So, the answer is 3 blue moons (January 31, June 30, and August 31) occurred on the 31st of the month (or in the case of June, the 30th) using Pruett's rule.


        


Generated answer: According to the text, using the Pruett rule, the blue moons that occurred on the 31st of the month between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II are:

1. January 31, 1915
2. August 31, 1915 (Pruett's)
3. August 31, 1934 (Pruett's)

So, the answer is 3 blue moons occurred on the 31st of the month using the Pruett rule. Additionally, October 31, 1944 is also mentioned as a blue moon date, but it is specified as "seasonal", not specifically Pruett's rule. However, another blue moon on October 31 is mentioned in the context as occurring in 1934, which is specified as "seasonal" but also as occurring according to Pruett's definition in the same year. 

Therefore, including October 31, the total number of blue moons that occurred on the 31st of the month using the Pruett rule is 4.

Check result: N
