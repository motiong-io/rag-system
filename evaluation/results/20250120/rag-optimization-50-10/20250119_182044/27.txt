        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
The text does not specifically mention the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947. However, according to the provided contexts, it can be inferred that during this period, Chelsea FC might have used a traditional numbering system where players wore numbers 1-11 based on their positions on the field.

Although this context does not specifically mention Chelsea FC or the years 1945-1947, it provides information about traditional numbering systems in UK football during that era.
