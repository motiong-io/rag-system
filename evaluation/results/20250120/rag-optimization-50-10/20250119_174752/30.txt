Generated answer: I'm not aware of any information that links a writer of "Culdcept Saga" to a specific birthplace with a population that I can provide. Could you provide more context or clarify which writer you are referring to? I'll do my best to help.

However, I can tell you that Culdcept is a video game series, and it was created by Omiya Soft, a Japanese game development company. If you're looking for the population of Japan, as of 2020, the estimated population was approximately 128 million people. Rounding to the nearest million, the answer would be: 130,000,000
