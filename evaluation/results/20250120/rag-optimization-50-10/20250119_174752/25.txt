Generated answer: To find the age difference, first, we need to determine the dates of their first losses.

Mike Tyson's first loss was to James "Buster" Douglas on February 11, 1990. Mike Tyson was born on June 30, 1966. 

Tyson Fury's first loss was to Francesco Pianeta wasn't his first loss but to Deontay Wilder didn't result in a loss for Fury either; however he did lose to Deontay Wilder in their rematch on February 22, 2020. Tyson Fury was born on August 12, 1988.

Now calculate their ages at the time of the fights:

Mike Tyson: from June 30, 1966, to February 11, 1990 = 23 years

Tyson Fury: from August 12, 1988, to February 22, 2020 = approximately 31 years

The difference between them is approximately: 

31 - (-7) since Mike was older by about seven years when he had his fight = approximately about eight; however that isn't correct since you are looking for how old one would have been when other had his or her fight so its 
31 (tyson fury) -23 (mike tyson)=8

Check result: N
