        obersevations:
        Which U.S. president won Alaska?:
Alaska was purchased from Russia by the United States in 1867, during the presidency of Andrew Johnson. The purchase was negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, and it is often referred to as "Seward's Folly." However, the idea of purchasing Alaska was first proposed by President James Buchanan in 1859, but it did not come to fruition during his presidency.

It's worth noting that Alaska was not won by a U.S. president in the sense of a military conquest, but rather it was purchased through a treaty between the United States and Russia.

Who is the U.S. president that graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael?:
Gerald Ford, the 38th President of the United States, graduated from Yale University with a law degree (LL.B.) and had a son named Michael.

What is the middle name of Andrew Johnson?:
Andrew Johnson's full name is Andrew Johnson, he doesn't have a middle name.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to combine the information from the previous observations.

The U.S. president who "won" Alaska was Andrew Johnson, as he was the president during which the purchase of Alaska from Russia was finalized in 1867.

The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael was Gerald Ford.

Now, let's look at the middle name of these presidents. Andrew Johnson does not have a middle name. Gerald Ford's full name is Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr., so his middle name is Rudolph.

However, neither of these presidents matches all the criteria simultaneously. Andrew Johnson was the president during the purchase of Alaska, but he does not have a middle name and did not graduate from Yale University. Gerald Ford graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael, but he was not the president during the purchase of Alaska.

Since there is no president that matches all the given criteria, we cannot determine a middle name for such a president.
