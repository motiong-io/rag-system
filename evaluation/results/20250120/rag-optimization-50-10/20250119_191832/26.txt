Generated answer: Based on the provided information, the blue moons that occurred on the 31st of the month according to the Pruett rule between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II are:

* January 31, 1915
* March 31, 1915
* September 30, 1917 (does not occur on the 31st)
* July 30, 1920 (does not occur on the 31st)
* April 30, 1923 (does not occur on the 31st)
* October 31, 1925
* January 31, 1930
* March 31, 1931
* August 31, 1932
* October 31, 1934
* January 31, 1938
* March 31, 1939
* August 31, 1940
* October 31, 1942
* January 31, 1943
* October 31, 1944

Counting these dates, there are a total of 13 blue moons that occurred on the following dates that end with the 31st:
* January 31 (1915, 1930, 1938, and 1943) - 4 times
* March 31 (1915 and 1931 and possibly another year) - at least 3 times

* August 31 (1932 and possibly another year and also in the year of1940) - at least 3 times 

Therefore, out of all the blue moons that occurred between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II according to the Pruett rule, at least a total of around (4 + at least 3 + at least 4 + at least 3) = around at least a total of more than or equal to around (14) blue moons occurred on the last day of a month which is also equal to around more than or equal to around (14/total number of blue moons during this time frame) percent.
