        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
The text does not specifically mention the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947. However, it does mention that Chelsea was one of the first teams to use numbered shirts in 1928, with numbers assigned by field location (e.g. 1 for goalkeeper, 2 for right full back, etc.). It also mentions that squad numbers became optional in The Football League in the late 1990s, but it does not provide information on the specific numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the 1940s. 

However, another part of the text mentions that in a traditional 4–4–2 system in the UK, the squad numbers 1–11 would usually have been assigned to specific positions on the field, such as:

1. Goalkeeper
2. Right full back
3. Left full back
4. Right half back
5. Centre half back
6. Left half back
7. Outside right
8. Inside right
9. Centre forward
10. Inside left
11. Outside left

It is likely that Chelsea FC used a similar system during the 1940s, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.

What position or role did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC, to determine the corresponding squad number?:
Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC. In a traditional 4-4-2 system, the squad numbers 1-11 would usually have been assigned to specific positions, with the centre-forward typically wearing the number 9 shirt. Therefore, it is likely that Tommy Lawton would have worn the number 9 shirt for Chelsea FC.
