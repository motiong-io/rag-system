Generated answer: Unfortunately, I don't have the exact number of employees for either ADP (the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500) or ZBRA (the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500) as of 2023. The provided text does not specify the number of employees for either company.

However, I can suggest some possible steps to find the answer. You can check the official websites of ADP and ZBRA, or look for recent news articles that provide information on the number of employees for each company. Once you have the employee counts for both companies, you can calculate the difference to find out how many more employees ADP has compared to ZBRA.
