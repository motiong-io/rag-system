        What year was William McCrary "Billy" Ray II born?:

In what year was Obama first sworn in as President to the United States?:
According to the text, Barack Obama was first sworn in as President of the United States on January 20, 2009.


        


Generated answer: To calculate the result, I need to follow these steps:

1. Subtract the year William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born (1963) from the year Obama was first sworn in as President (2009).
2009 - 1963 = 46

2. Multiply the result by the number of administrative regions in France. As of my knowledge cutoff, France has 18 administrative regions (as of 2016, but this may have changed). Assuming it's still around that number or close to it and considering I don't have information about changes after my cutoff date, let's proceed with a general assumption for calculation purposes.

However, please note that as of January 1, 2024 (or more specifically January 1, 2016), there are indeed changes and now there are actually fewer - specifically there being only about a certain lower amount due to mergers: 
There were originally more but then they got reduced down into just thirteen.


So using this updated figure:
46 * 13 = 598

Therefore, if we subtract William McCrary "Billy" Ray II birth year from Obama's first swearing-in year and multiply by what is presumably an accurate count for current French administrative areas then we would get approximately: 
598

Check result: N
