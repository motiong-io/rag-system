    "Question": "Imagine there is a building called Bronte tower whose height in feet is the same number as the dewey decimal classification for the Charlotte Bronte book that was published in 1847. Where would this building rank among tallest buildings in New York City, as of August 2024?",
    "Answer": "37th",
    "Result": "If Bronte Tower has a height of 823.8 feet, it would be ranked among the tallest buildings in New York City. As of August 2024, the tallest building in New York City is One World Trade Center, which stands at 1,776 feet. \n\nTo determine the ranking of Bronte Tower at 823.8 feet, we can compare it to other notable buildings:\n\n1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet\n2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet\n3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet\n4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet\n5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet\n6. The Spiral - 1,041 feet\n7. 30 Hudson Yards - 1,296 feet\n8. Empire State Building - 1,454 feet (including its antenna)\n\nGiven that 823.8 feet is significantly shorter than these buildings, Bronte Tower would likely rank lower on the list, possibly around the 20th to 30th position, depending on the exact heights of other buildings in that range. However, without the exact heights of all buildings, it's difficult to provide a precise ranking.",

    "Result": "The chemical element discovered for the first time in 1791 is titanium, which was discovered by William Gregor. William Gregor was born on December 3, 1761.
