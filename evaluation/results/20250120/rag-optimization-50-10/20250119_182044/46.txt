        What are the 10 largest countries by land area in Europe as of August 1, 2024?:
Based on the provided information, here are the 10 largest countries by land area in Europe as of my knowledge cutoff:

1. Russia (partially in Asia) - 3,952,550 km²
2. Ukraine - 603,549 km²
3. France - 543,941 km²
4. Spain - 498,485 km²
5. Sweden - 438,574 km²
6. Germany - 357,581 km²
7. Finland - 336,884 km²
8. Norway - 323,772 km²
9. Poland - 312,679 km²
10. Italy - 301,958 km²

Please note that these figures might have changed slightly since my knowledge cutoff date due to various factors such as territorial disputes or changes in geographical definitions.

Also worth noting is that while Russia is partially in Asia and has a significant portion of its landmass outside of Europe (approximately 75% of its total area), for the purpose of this ranking and based on common geographical classifications that consider it a transcontinental country with a significant part in Europe (around 25% or roughly around ~3.9-4 million square kilometers being within European boundaries), I've included it here reflecting its often-cited status among European nations by area when considering only its European portion.

Keep in mind these numbers may not reflect any updates after August of this year if there were changes to national borders or geographic measurements post-data cut-off date used for generating responses like mine today!

Which country is the 9th largest among them?:
Poland is the 9th largest country, covering an area of 312,679 km2 (120,726 sq mi), which accounts for 3.1% of Europe's total area.

What is the largest city of Poland?:
The largest city of Poland is Warsaw, with a population of over 1.8 million inhabitants.
