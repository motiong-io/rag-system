Generated answer: To answer this question, I need to follow a series of connections. 

First, I know that Giancarlo Martini is a racing driver from Italy who drove a Ferrari 312T. 

Next, I found out that the nephew of Giancarlo Martini is Pierluigi Martini, an Italian former racing driver.

Lastly, in 1994, Pierluigi Martini drove for the Minardi team in Formula One and also for the Lotus team but most notably he drove the Minardi M193B and Minardi M194 cars but also the Lotus 107C and then later in 1994 season he drove for Lotus and then back to Minardi but most notably he drove for Minardi so his car was likely a Minardi.

So, putting all these pieces together, I can conclude that in 1994, Pierluigi Martini likely drove a Minardi M193B or more likely a Minardi M194.
