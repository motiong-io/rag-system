States federal executive departments** are the principal units of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States. They are analogous to ministries common in parliamentary or semi-presidential systems but (the United States being a presidential system) they are led by a head of government who is also the head of state. The executive departments are the administrative arms of the president of the United States. There are currently 15 executive departments.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n### Structure\n\nEach department is headed by a secretary whose title echoes the title of their respective department, with the exception of the Department of Justice, whose head is known as the attorney general. The heads of the executive departments are appointed by the president and take office after confirmation by the United States Senate, and serve at the pleasure of the president. The heads of departments are members of the Cabinet of the United States, an executive organ that normally acts as an advisory body to the president. In the Opinion Clause (Article II, section 2, clause 1\\) of the U.S. Constitution, heads of executive departments are referred to as \"principal Officer in each of the executive Departments\".\n\nThe heads of executive departments are included in the line of succession to the president, in the event of a vacancy in the presidency, after the vice president, the speaker of the House, and the president pro tempore of the Senate. They are included in order of their respective department's formation, with the exception of the Secretary of Defense, whose position in the line of succession is based on when the Department of War was formed.\n\n### Separation of powers\n\nTo enforce a strong separation of powers, the federal Constitution's Ineligibility Clause expressly prohibits executive branch employees (including heads of executive departments) from simultaneously serving in Congress, and vice versa. Accordingly, in sharp contrast to virtually all other Western democracies (parliamentary systems) where ministers are selected to form a government from members of parliament, U.S. legislators who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve as heads of executive departments must resign from Congress before assuming their new positions. If the emoluments for a new appointee's executive branch position were increased while the appointee was previously serving in Congress (e.g., cost of living adjustments), the president must implement a Saxbe fix.\n\n### Contracting and grantmaking roles\n\nAs is evident from the chart below, several executive departments (Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation) have disproportionately small employee headcounts in contrast to the size of their budgets. This is because many of their employees merely supervise contracts with private independent contractors or grants (especially categorical grants) to state or local government agencies who are primarily responsible for providing services directly to the general public. In the 20th century, when the federal government began to provide funding and supervision for matters which were historically seen as the domain of state governments (i.e., education, health and welfare services, housing, and transportation), Congress frequently authorized only funding for grants which were voluntary, in the sense that state or local government agencies could choose to apply for such grants (and accept conditions attached by Congress) or they could decline to apply. In the case of HHS's Medicare program, Congress chose to contract with private health insurers because they \"already possessed the requisite expertise for administering complex health insurance programs\", and because American hospitals preferred to continue dealing with private insurers instead of a new federal bureaucracy.\n\nCurrent departments\n-------------------\n\n| Department | Seal | Flag | Formed | Employees | Total budget | Head | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title | Titleholder | |\n| State |  |  | July 27, 1789 | 30,000(2023\\) | $58\\.1 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of State | Antony Blinken |  |\n| Treasury |  |  | September 2, 1789 | 100,000(2023\\) | $16\\.4 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of the Treasury | Janet Yellen |  |\n| Interior |  |  | March 3, 1849 | 70,000(2023\\) | $35 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of the Interior | Deb Haaland |  |\n| Agriculture |  |  | May 15, 1862 | 100,000(2023\\) | $242 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Agriculture | Tom Vilsack |  |\n| Justice |  |  | July 1, 1870 | 113,543(2012\\) | $37\\.5 billion(2023\\) | Attorney General | Merrick Garland |  |\n| Commerce |  |  | February 14, 1903 | 41,000(2023\\) | $16\\.3 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Commerce | Gina Raimondo |  |\n| Labor |  |  | March 4, 1913 | 15,000(2023\\) | $97\\.5 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Labor | Julie Su (acting) |  |\n| Defense |  |  | September 18, 1947 | 3,200,000(2023\\) | $852 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Defense | Lloyd Austin |  |\n| Housing and Urban Development |  |  | September 9, 1965 | 9,000(2023\\) | $61\\.7 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Housing and Urban Development | Adrianne Todman (acting) |  |\n| Transportation |  |  | April 1, 1967 | 55,000(2023\\) | $145 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Transportation | Pete Buttigieg |  |\n| Energy |  |  | August 4, 1977 | 10,000(2023\\) | $45\\.8 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Energy | Jennifer Granholm |  |\n| Health and Human Services |  |  | October 17, 1979 | 65,000(2023\\) | $1\\.772 trillion(2023\\) | Secretary of Health and Human Services | Xavier Becerra |  |\n| Education |  |  | October 17, 1979 | 4,200(2023\\) | $79\\.6 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Education | Miguel Cardona |  |\n| Veterans Affairs |  |  | March 15, 1989 | 235,000(2023\\) | $308\\.5 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Veterans Affairs | Denis McDonough |  |\n| Homeland Security |  |  | November 25, 2002 | 250,000(2023\\) | $101\\.6 billion(2023\\) | Secretary of Homeland Security | Alejandro Mayorkas |  |\n\nFormer departments\n------------------\n\n| Department | Formed | Removed from Cabinet | Superseded by | Last Cabinet-level head | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title | Titleholder |\n| War | August 7, 1789 | September 18, 1947 | Department of the ArmyDepartment of the Air Force | Secretary of War | Kenneth Claiborne Royall |\n| Army | September 18, 1947 | August 10, 1949 | Department of Defense(as executive department)*became and still are military departments within the Department of Defense* | Secretary of the Army | Gordon Gray |\n| Air Force | Secretary of the Air Force | Stuart Symington |\n| Navy | April 30, 1798 | August 10, 1949 | Department of Defense(as executive department)*became and still is a military department within the Department of Defense* | Secretary of the Navy | Francis P.
