        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
The text does not specifically mention the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947. However, it does mention that Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Tommy Lawton scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. 

But according to another part of the text, in the first game at Stamford Bridge in 1928, the outfield players wore numbers (2–11). The numbers were assigned by field location:
1. Goalkeeper
2. Right full back (right side centre back)
3. Left full back (left side centre back)
4. Right half back (right side defensive midfield)
5. Centre half back (centre defensive midfield)
6. Left half back (left side defensive midfield)
7. Outside right (right winger)
8. Inside right (attacking midfield)
9. Centre forward
10. Inside left (attacking midfield)
11. Outside left (left winger)

It can be assumed that a similar system may have been used during the years 1945 to 1947, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.

What position or role did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC, to determine the corresponding squad number?:
Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC. In a traditional 4-4-2 system, which was common during his time, the squad numbers 1-11 would usually have been assigned to players in specific positions. For a centre-forward, the typical squad number would have been 9.


        


Generated answer: Based on the information provided, Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC. Given the traditional numbering system used during his time, where the centre-forward typically wore the number 9, it is likely that Tommy Lawton would have worn the number 9 while playing for Chelsea FC.
