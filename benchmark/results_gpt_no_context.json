    "Answer": "Mendelevium is named after Dmitri Mendeleev.",
    "Result": "To solve this, we need to identify the element with an atomic number that is 9 higher than another element discovered by the scientist who discovered Zirconium.\n\n1. **Identify the atomic number of Zirconium**: Zirconium (Zr) has an atomic number of 40.\n2. **Find the element with an atomic number 9 higher**: 40 + 9 = 49. The element with atomic number 49 is Indium (In).\n3. **Identify the scientist who discovered Zirconium**: Zirconium was discovered by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789.\n4. **Find the element discovered by Klaproth in the same year**: Klaproth also discovered Uranium (U) in 1789, which has an atomic number of 92.\n\nNow, we need to find out who Indium is named after.
