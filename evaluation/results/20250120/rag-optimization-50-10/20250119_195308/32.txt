        How many times had Brazil won the World Cup as of 2010?:
As of 2010, Brazil had won the World Cup 5 times (1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, and 2002).

How many times had the Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship as of 2010?:

Generated answer: To solve this, we need to know the number of times the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl as of 2010. Although this information isn't provided in the initial observations, I can look it up for you. As of 2010, the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl 5 times.

Now, let's calculate:

1. Brazil won the World Cup 5 times.
2. The Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship 6 times.
3. Adding these two numbers together: 5 + 6 = 11
4. Multiplying this sum by the number of Super Bowl wins by the Dallas Cowboys (5): 11 * 5 = 55

So, as of 2010, if you added the number of times Brazil had won the World Cup to the amount of times the Chicago Bulls had won the NBA Championship and multiplied this number by the amount of times the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl, you would be left with 55.
