Generated answer: As of my knowledge cutoff, the Dewey Decimal Classification for the book "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë, published in 1847, is 823.8. 

If we assume the height of the Bronte Tower is 823.8 feet, we can compare it to the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024.

According to my knowledge, the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City are:
1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet
2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet
3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet
4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet
5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet

The Bronte Tower, at 823.8 feet, would not be among the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City. In fact, it would be significantly shorter than the top 5.

To give you a better idea, the Bronte Tower would likely rank outside the top 20 tallest buildings in New York City. Some examples of buildings around that height are:
- The New York Times Building - 748 feet (ranked 34th)
- The Chrysler Center - 817 feet (ranked 41st)
- One Penn Plaza - 757 feet (ranked 32nd)

So, the Bronte Tower would likely rank somewhere between 30th to 50th among the tallest buildings in New York City, as of August 2024.
