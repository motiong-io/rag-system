**Kathleen Genevieve Ledecky** (/ləˈdɛki/ ⓘ lə-DEK-ee; born March 17, 1997\) is an American competitive swimmer. She has won nine Olympic gold medals and 21 world championship gold medals, the most in history for a female swimmer. With 14 medals and 9 gold medals, she is also the most decorated American woman, most decorated female swimmer, the woman with the most gold medals (tied with Larisa Latynina) and fifth-most decorated athlete in Olympic history. She has won a record 16 individual gold medals at the World Aquatics Championships. Ledecky's 10 individual medals at the Olympics and 26 overall medals at the World Aquatics Championships are records in women's swimming‌. Ledecky is the world record holder in the women's 800- and 1500-meter freestyle (both long course and short course), as well as the former world record holder in the women's 400-meter freestyle (long course). She also holds the fastest-ever times in the women's 500-, 1000-, and 1650-yard freestyle events. She is widely regarded as the greatest female swimmer of all time and one of the greatest Olympians of all time.

In her international debut at the 2012 London Olympic Games as a 15-year-old, Ledecky unexpectedly won the gold medal in the women's 800-metre freestyle. Four years later, she left Rio de Janeiro as the most decorated female athlete of the 2016 Olympic Games, with four gold medals, one silver medal, and two world records. At the 2020 Olympic Games, Ledecky emerged as the most decorated U.S. female athlete and became the first American female swimmer to win an individual event in three straight Olympiads. In 2023, she won gold in the 800 meter World Championship, becoming the first swimmer—male or female—to win six World Championship gold medals in the same event. In total, she has won 50 medals (38 golds, 10 silvers, and 2 bronzes) in major international competitions, spanning the Summer Olympics, World Championships, and Pan Pacific Championships. During her career, she has broken 16 world records.

Ledecky's success has earned her *Swimming World*'s Female World Swimmer of the Year a record five times. Ledecky was also named Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year in 2017 and 2022, international female Champion of Champions by *L'Équipe* in 2014 and 2017, United States Olympic Committee Female Athlete of the Year in 2013, 2016 and 2017, Sportswoman of the Year by the Women's Sports Foundation in 2017, and the ESPY Best Female Athlete in 2022\. In 2024, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden.

Early life, swimming, and education
-----------------------------------

Ledecky was born in Washington, DC  and raised in the suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, the daughter of Mary Gen (née Hagan) and David Ledecky. Her Czech-born paternal grandfather Jaromír Ledecky arrived in New York City on September 8, 1947, as a student. He later became an economist and married an Ashkenazi Jewish woman named Berta Ruth Greenwald in Brooklyn on December 30, 1956\. Through her paternal grandmother, Ledecky has relatives who were murdered in the Holocaust. Ledecky's mother is of Irish descent. She was raised Catholic and continues to practice the faith, often praying the Hail Mary before her races. Her uncle Jon Ledecky is a businessman and a co-owner of the NHL team New York Islanders.

Ledecky began swimming at the age of six under the influence of her older brother, Michael, and her mother, who swam for the University of New Mexico. In Bethesda, she attended Little Flower School through eighth grade and graduated from Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart in 2015\. During her high-school swimming career, Ledecky twice set the American and US Open record in the 500-yard freestyle, and she twice set the national high-school record in the 200-yard freestyle.

During the summer of 2012, she trained with the Nation's Capital Swim Club (formerly the Curl Burke Swim Club) under coach Yuri Suguiyama. Following Suguiyama's departure to coach for the University of California, Berkeley, she continued to train with the Nation's Capital Swim Club under coach Bruce Gemmell through the 2016 Olympics. During the summers prior to 2012, she swam for Palisades Swim Team in Cabin John, Maryland. Ledecky accepted an athletic scholarship to Stanford University, where she swam for coach Greg Meehan's Stanford Cardinal women's swimming team.

In December 2016, Ledecky was chosen as one of the sponsors of the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Enterprise alongside Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Simone Biles. They are the first Olympians to be given this honor.

In December 2020, she completed a Bachelor of Arts in psychology and minor in political science from Stanford University, and graduated in June 2021\.

Swimming career
---------------

### 2012

At the 2012 United States Olympic trials in Omaha, Nebraska (her first senior national competition), Ledecky made the Olympic team by placing first in the 800-meter freestyle with a time of 8:19\.78, which was over two seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kate Ziegler. In Omaha, Ledecky also placed third in the 400-meter freestyle (4:05\.00\) and ninth in the 200-meter freestyle (1:58\.66\). Her third-place finish in the 400-meter freestyle was the fastest time ever swum by a 15- to 16-year-old American. At 15 years, 4 months, and 10 days, she was the youngest American participant at the 2012 Olympic Games.

| 2012 Summer Olympics | | |

| Gold medal – first place | 800 m freestyle | 8:14\.63 (NR) |

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Ledecky qualified to swim in the final of the 800-meter freestyle by placing third overall in the heats with a time of 8:23\.84\. In the final, Ledecky stunned the field, winning gold by more than four seconds, with a time of 8:14\.63, the then second-fastest effort of all time just behind Rebecca Adlington's world record of 8:14\.10 set in 2008\. In addition, she broke Janet Evans' American record of 8:16\.22 that had stood since 1989\. In the final, Ledecky went out hard and, by the 200-meter mark, she had already established an almost body-length lead. Her 400-meter split was 4:04\.34, a personal best for Ledecky in that distance, and would have placed fifth in the individual 400-meter freestyle. At the 750-meter mark, Ledecky was 3\.42 seconds ahead of Mireia Belmonte García, and 0\.31 seconds under world record pace. Ledecky won by 4\.13 seconds and just missed the world record by 0\.53 seconds. Her gold was the first international medal of her career, earning her the 2012 Best Female Performance of the Year and Breakout Performer of the Year at the Golden Goggle Awards.

### 2013

At the 2013 US National Championships, Ledecky qualified to swim in four individual events and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain, though she later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from her program. At the National Championships, she finished first in the 400-, 800- and 1500-meter freestyle, and second in the 200-meter freestyle.

| 2013 World Championships | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gold medal – first place | 400 m freestyle | 3:59\.82 (NR) |
| Gold medal – first place | 800 m freestyle | 8:13\.86 (WR) |
| Gold medal – first place | 1500 m freestyle | 15:36\.53 (WR) |
| Gold medal – first place | 4 × 200 m freestyle | 7:45\.14 |

At the 2013 World Championships, Ledecky won gold in the 400-, 800-, and 1500-meter freestyle, and in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, and set two world records. In winning the 400 through 1500-meter titles, she became the second woman ever to win the events in a World Championships since German Hannah Stockbauer in 2003\. In her first event in Barcelona, the 400-meter freestyle, Ledecky became a world champion for the first time by winning in 3:59\.82, setting a new American record and becoming the second-fastest performer of all time in the event.

In her second event, Ledecky won gold in the 1500-meter freestyle in a world record time of 15:36\.53, breaking the record held by compatriot Kate Ziegler by six seconds. The hard-fought race saw Ledecky overcome Dane Lotte Friis in the final few hundred meters after losing the lead at the 300-meter mark and included a final 50 split of 29\.47\.

In her third, and first relay event of her international career, the 4×200-meter freestyle, Ledecky and teammates Shannon Vreeland, Karlee Bispo, and Missy Franklin won gold in 7:45\.14\. Anchor Missy Franklin overtook Australian Alicia Coutts in the last 200 meters, giving the US the gold. Ledecky provided the US with an early lead, swimming the first leg in a personal best of 1:56\.32\.

In her fourth and last event, the 800-meter freestyle, Ledecky won gold in a world record of 8:13\.86, bettering Rebecca Adlington's world record of 8:14\.10\. Much like the 1500-meter freestyle, Ledecky let Lotte Friis lead most of the race, making a move at the 650-meter mark to eventually win the race by 2\.46 seconds.

Ledecky scored more points than any other swimmer to earn the FINA trophy for best female swimmer of the meet.

At year's end, Ledecky was named the American Swimmer of the Year and the World Swimmer of the Year by *Swimming World* magazine. She was also named the best female swimmer for 2013 by *FINA Aquatics World* magazine.

### 2014

Ledecky began the year by breaking her own world records in the 800- and 1500-meter freestyle at the 2014 Woodlands Swim Team Senior Invitational in June. Despite being in season and swimming multiple events, Ledecky was able to first break the world record in the 1500-meter freestyle with a time of 15:34\.23, bettering her previous mark of 15:36\.53\. Three days later, Ledecky then broke the world record in the 800-meter freestyle with a time of 8:11\.00, bettering her previous mark of 8:13\.86\.

At the 2014 US National Championships, the qualifying meet for both the 2014 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2015 World Aquatics Championships, Ledecky finished first in the 200-, 400-, and 800-meter freestyle. In the 400-meter freestyle, Ledecky set her third world record of the year by breaking Federica Pellegrini's 2009 world record of 3:59\.15 with a time of 3:58\.86\. With her mark in the 400, Ledecky became the first female since Janet Evans to hold world records simultaneously in the 400-, 800-, and 1500-meter freestyles.

At the 2014 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Gold Coast, Australia, Ledecky won five gold medals and broke two world records. Her wins came in the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1500-meter freestyle and the 4×200-meter freestyle. Ledecky almost broke the world record in the 800-meter freestyle, finishing with a time of 8:11\.35\. Her world records came in the 400- and 1500-meter freestyles, with times of 3:58\.37 and 15:28\.36, respectively. She became the first woman to win four individual gold medals at a single Pan Pacific Championship.

In the 200-meter freestyle final, Ledecky had over a half-second lead on the field at the halfway point before winning by 1\.46 seconds with a meet record time of 1:55\.74\. Less than an hour later, Ledecky won the 800-meter freestyle, swimming under her world record pace for most of the race before touching in at 8:11\.35, the second-fastest time ever, to win by 7\.52 seconds over New Zealand swimmer Lauren Boyle.

The next day, Ledecky added her third meet record by swimming on the American 4×200-meter freestyle relay team with Shannon Vreeland, Missy Franklin, and Leah Smith. Swimming the anchor leg, Ledecky erased a 1\.2-second deficit going into the final leg of the race, passing Australia's Melanie Schlanger with a 1:54\.36 split over the final 200 meters. She also swam in the 100-meter freestyle heats.

On the third day of the meet, Ledecky set her fourth meet record in the 400-meter freestyle prelim heats with a time of 4:03\.09\. That night, Ledecky lowered the record again, setting the first world record ever at the new Gold Coast Aquatic Center with a time of 3:58\.37\. Ledecky's winning time was over six seconds quicker than American teammate and silver medalist Cierra Runge.

On the meet's final day, Ledecky set her fifth world record of the year, lowering her record in the 1500-meter freestyle by nearly six seconds with a time of 15:28\.36\. Ledecky swam the second half of the race faster than the first, completing the final 800 meters in 8:14\.11—faster than any other woman has completed a regular 800-meter race in a textile suit. Ledecky lapped three competitors in the final and finished 27\.33 seconds ahead of silver medalist Boyle. National Team Director Frank Busch described Ledecky's 1500 performance as "the most impressive race I have ever seen, and I've been in the sport for 50 years.... She's blazing a completely different trail than anyone who has come before."

During the championships' closing ceremonies, Ledecky was named the female swimmer of the meet.

At year's end, Ledecky was named the World Swimmer of the Year and American Swimmer of the Year by *Swimming World Magazine*.

At the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Russia, Ledecky won five gold medals and broke three world records. Her wins came in the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1500-meter freestyles and the 4×200-meter freestyle. Her world records came in the 800- and 1500-meter freestyles. Ledecky became the first and only swimmer—male or female—to win the 200-, 400-, 800- and 1500-meter freestyles in a major competition. Ledecky was also named the female swimmer of the meet.

Ledecky began the World Championships by winning gold in the 400-meter freestyle in a time of 3:59\.13, a new championship record and almost four seconds ahead of her closest competitor.

In the heats of the 1500-meter freestyle on the second day of competition, Ledecky broke her own world record in a time of 15:27\.71\.

On the third day of competition during the morning session, Ledecky swam in the heats of the 200-meter freestyle and qualified first with a time of 1:55\.82\. In the evening session, Ledecky faced a tough double with the 1500-meter freestyle final and the semi-finals of the 200-meter freestyle shortly after. In the 1500-meter freestyle, Ledecky broke her own world record in a time of 15:25\.48\. Twenty-nine minutes later, Ledecky qualified 6th in the 200-meter freestyle with a time of 1:56\.76\.

In her only event on the fourth day of competition, the 200-meter freestyle, Ledecky won her third gold medal of the meet, winning in a time of 1:55\.16\. Unlike her other races, it was not an easy win for Ledecky, which featured the likes of Missy Franklin and Federica Pellegrini.
