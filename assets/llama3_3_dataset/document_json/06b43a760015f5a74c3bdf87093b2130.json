In the 1960 presidential election, Alaska was narrowly won by the Republican Party's candidate and incumbent vice president Richard Nixon, defeating the Democratic Party's candidate John F. Kennedy by a margin of just 1\\.88% (1,144 votes). In the 1964 presidential election, the Democratic Party's candidate Lyndon B. Johnson won Alaska in a national Democratic landslide victory. Since the 1964 election, Alaska has been won by the Republican Party in every presidential election. However, no Republican candidate has gotten 55% of the statewide vote since 2008\\. Donald Trump received 54\\.5% in 2024\\.\n\nRonald Reagan, the Republican candidate in the 1984 presidential election, won Alaska by 36\\.78%, which remains the largest margin of victory in the state's history. Ross Perot, the independent candidate in the 1992 presidential election, received the highest vote share (28\\.43%) ever won by a third-party candidate in Alaska. Various news organizations have characterized Alaska as a safe Republican state. No Republican has won the presidency without carrying Alaska since its statehood in 1959 due to Lyndon B. Johnson being the only Democratic candidate to ever carry the state. Alaska is tied with Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma for the longest Republican voting streak for any state in recent political history, from 1968 to present.\n\nPresidential elections\n----------------------\n\n| Key for parties |\n| --- |\n| American Independent Party \u2013 (AI)   Democratic Party \u2013 (D)   Green Party \u2013 (G)   Independent candidate \u2013 (I)   Libertarian Party \u2013 (LI)   Reform Party \u2013 (RE)   Republican Party \u2013 (R) **Note** \u2013 A double dagger (\u2021) indicates the national winner. |\n\nPresidential elections in Alaska from 1960 to present\n\n| Year | Winner | | | | Runner-up | | | | Other candidates\\[a] | | | | EV | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Candidate | | Votes | % | Candidate | | Votes | % | Candidate | | Votes | % |\n| 1960 |  | **Richard Nixon** (R) | 30,953 | 50\\.94% |  | John F.
