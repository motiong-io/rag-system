What percentage of the population in New Jersey speaks a language that is not native to the United States in 2024?:
According to the provided text, as of 2024, the following percentages of the population in New Jersey speak a language that is not native to the United States:

* Spanish: 15.9%
* Indo-Aryan: 2.7%
* Chinese: 1.5%
* Korean: 1.1%
* French: 0.97%
* Tagalog: 0.94%
* Portuguese: 0.91%
* Italian: 0.83% (although Italian is not entirely non-native, as there are native Italian-American speakers)
* Arabic: 0.76%
* Polish: 0.72%
* Russian: 0.57%

To find the total percentage of the population that speaks a non-native language, we need to add up these percentages and subtract the percentage of people who speak only English (69.4%). However, since some individuals may speak multiple languages, including English and a non-native language, this calculation might not be entirely accurate.

Assuming that all individuals who speak these languages also speak English or another native language (which may not be true), we can estimate that around:

100% - 69.4% = approximately 30-31% 

of New Jersey's population speaks at least one non-native language at home.

Keep in mind that this calculation has limitations due to potential overlaps between languages spoken by individuals and does not account for other factors like bilingualism or multilingualism within households.

Therefore, it can be estimated roughly around thirty percent but please note it could vary based on how you interpret "speaks a language" in context with those numbers given above which themselves don't directly answer what portion exclusively use them versus alongside an official U.S tongue such english etcetera .

Which country is native to the language spoken by 0.94% of the population in New Jersey?:
