None of the given contexts provide information about calculating absolute differences between numbers. However, I can still calculate the absolute difference for you.


The absolute difference between 23 and 35 is |23 - 35| = |-12| = 12.

What was the age of Mike Tyson on February 11, 1990?:
According to the text, Mike Tyson was born on June 30, 1966. Therefore, on February 11, 1990, he was 23 years old.


        


Generated answer: To find the age difference, we need to calculate the ages of both Mike Tyson and Tyson Fury on the days they lost their first fights.

Mike Tyson's first loss was on February 11, 1990. He was born on June 30, 1966, so he was 23 years old at that time.

Tyson Fury's first loss was on May 18, 2024. He was born on August 12, 1988. To calculate his age at the time of his first loss: 
2024 - 1988 = 36 years. Since his birthday is in August and the fight took place in May, he wasn't yet 36 years old when he had his fight. Therefore, at that time he would be still considered as being only about to turn or nearly turning but not yet turned into a new year older than what would have been if it were after August which means we can say roughly around or just before turning into being actually aged thirty-six (35).

Now let's find their age difference:
Age difference = Age of Tyson Fury - Age of Mike Tyson
= Approximately around (35) - (23)
= Approximately around twelve 

So approximately twelve years apart from one another based upon those respective dates mentioned within question itself regarding each fighter having experienced an initial professional boxing match defeat during careers spanning over multiple decades apart starting back then going forward up until now today respectively speaking here!
