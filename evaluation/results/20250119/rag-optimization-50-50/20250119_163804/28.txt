Generated answer: To solve this problem, we need to know the following information:

1. The year William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born: 1963
2. The year Obama was first sworn in as President: 2009
3. The number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024: 18 (including 13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions)

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Subtract the year William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born from the year Obama was first sworn in as President:
2009 - 1963 = 46

Multiply the result by the number of administrative regions in France:
46 * 18 = 828

So, the result would be 828.

Check result: Y
