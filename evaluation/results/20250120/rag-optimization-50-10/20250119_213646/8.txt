Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps.

First, we know that the General Motors vehicle is named after the largest ward in Monaco, which is Monte Carlo. The vehicle is the Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

Next, we need to find out the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo was first introduced in 1970 as a 1970 model.

Now, we need to determine how many people had walked on the moon as of the 1970 model year. Since the model year 1970 refers to cars that were available for purchase in the fall of 1969, we should consider missions that took place before the fall of 1969.

As of the fall of 1969, two missions had successfully landed humans on the moon: Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 were not completed by then but Apollo 11 was. 

Therefore, as of the first model year (1970) of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, a total of 2 people had walked on the moon: 

1. Neil Armstrong
2. Buzz Aldrin

Check result: N
