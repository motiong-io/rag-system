As for your question, Pompeii was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980. The session where this decision was made was held in Sydney, Australia, but more specifically,  it was at the 4th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which took place from September 22 to October 1, 1980, but I couldn't find information on the exact location within Sydney where the session was held.
