Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to know the birth year of Simon Fraser, the person after whom the Fraser River is named, and the founding year of Harvard University.

The Fraser River is the longest river in British Columbia that only flows within the province. It is named after Simon Fraser, who was born in 1776.

Harvard University was founded in 1636. 

To find the age of Harvard University when Simon Fraser was born, we subtract the founding year from the birth year: 1776 - 1636 = 140.

So, Harvard University was 140 years old when Simon Fraser, the person after whom the Fraser River is named, was born.
