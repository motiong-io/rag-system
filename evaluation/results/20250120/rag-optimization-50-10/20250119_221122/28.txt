        What year was William McCrary "Billy" Ray II born?:
William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born in 1963.

What year was Obama first sworn in as President to the United States?:
According to the text, Barack Obama was first sworn in as President of the United States on January 20, 2009.

If you subtract 1963 from 2009 and multiply it by the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024, what number would you get?:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, subtract 1963 from 2009:
2009 - 1963 = 46

Then, we need to know the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024. According to the provided contexts, as of 2016, there were 18 regions (13 metropolitan and 5 overseas) in France, and there is no information provided that this number has changed since then. Therefore, we will assume the number of regions is still 18.

Now, multiply the result by the number of administrative regions:
46 * 18 = 828

So, the result of the calculation is 828.


        


Generated answer: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, subtract the year that William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born (1963) from the year Obama was first sworn in as President to the United States (2009):
2009 - 1963 = 46

Then, we need to know the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024. Although the exact number as of 2024 is not provided, we can use the information that as of 2016, there were 18 regions (13 metropolitan and 5 overseas) in France, and there is no information provided that this number has changed since then. Therefore, we will assume the number of regions is still 18, but please note that this might not be up-to-date.

Now, multiply the result by the number of administrative regions:
46 * 18 = 828

So, the result of the calculation is 828.

Check result: Y
