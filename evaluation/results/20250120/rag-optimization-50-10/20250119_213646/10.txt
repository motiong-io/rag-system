        Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart?:
According to the provided text, Clarice Beckett (1887–1935) is not born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. However, another Australian artist, Jessie Traill, is not mentioned to be born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart either. 

But one of the artists mentioned in the list of notable members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors is Amalie Sara Colquhoun (1894–1974), who is not born in 1883. 

Another artist mentioned is Alice Marian Ellen Bale (1875–1955), who was also not born in 1883.

However, one artist that could fit this description is Cristina Asquith Baker (1868–1960), but she was born 15 years before Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

Unfortunately, based on the provided text, I couldn't find any information about an Australian artist that shares the same birth year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart and a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors?:
Clarice Beckett (1887–1935) was not born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. 

The answer is not explicitly stated in the given text, but based on the information provided in the "Notable members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors" section, one possible answer could be Amalie Sara Colquhoun (1894–1974) is not born the same year, however,  Lina Bryans (1909–2000) is also not. 

The correct answer is likely to be Ethel Carrick (1872–1952) or other members listed, but none of them are born in 1883 except for none.

The answer is not explicitly stated in the given contexts, but based on the information provided in the context about notable members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, one possible answer could be that there is no information about an Australian artist born in 1883 who is also a fellow member of the society. However, another member, Amalie Sara Colquhoun (1894–1974) is not born the same year, but other members like Alice Marian Ellen Bale (1875–1955), Margaret Francis Ellen Baskerville (1861–1930), and others are also not born in 1883.

However, one member Lina Bryans (1909–2000) is not born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. But another member Ethel Carrick (1872–1952) is also not born in 1883.

But there is no information about any other member being born in 1883 except for Janet Cumbrae Stewart herself.


        


Generated answer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about the specific painting that was featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923. The text doesn't provide enough details to determine the name of the painting or the artist who created it, except that the artist is a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and was born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883).
