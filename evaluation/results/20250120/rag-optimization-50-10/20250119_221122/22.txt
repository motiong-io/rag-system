Generated answer: To find the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census, as per the 1990 United States census, we need to consider the populations of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as they are the only two cities that had a population of over 100,000 in 2020 and also had significant populations in 1990. Norman and Broken Arrow did not have a population of over 100,000 in 1990.

The population of Oklahoma City in 1990 was 444,719, and the population of Tulsa in 1990 was 367,302. 

So, the total population of these cities in 1990 would be: 
444,719 (Oklahoma City) + 367,302 (Tulsa) = 812,021.

Therefore, the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census, as per the 1990 United States census, is 812,021.
