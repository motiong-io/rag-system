Generated answer: To answer your question, I need to follow a series of logical steps. 

First, based on your description of the Ancient Roman City being destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, I believe the city you are thinking of is either Pompeii or Herculaneum. 

Next, I know that the volcano responsible for the destruction of these cities is Mount Vesuvius, which is indeed a stratovolcano.

Finally, to determine where the session was held where it was decided that the city would be named a UNESCO world heritage site, I need to consider the UNESCO world heritage site designation for Pompeii and Herculaneum. 

Pompeii and Herculaneum, along with Torre Annunziata, were designated as UNESCO world heritage sites in 1980. The session where this decision was made was held in Sydney, Australia, but more specifically,  it was at the 4th session of the World Heritage Committee in Paris in 1980 that these sites were inscribed as the "Archaeological Areas of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Torre Annunziata".
