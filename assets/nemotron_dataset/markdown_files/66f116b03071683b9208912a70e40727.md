# List of presidents of the United States by education

Most presidents of the United States received a college education, even most of the earliest. Of the first seven presidents, five were college graduates. College degrees have set the presidents apart from the general population, and presidents have held degrees even though it was quite rare and unnecessary for practicing most occupations, including law. Of the 45 individuals to have been the president, 24 graduated from a private undergraduate college, 9 graduated from a public undergraduate college, and 12 held no degree. Every president since 1953 has had a bachelor's degree, reflecting the increasing importance of higher education in the United States.

List by university attended
---------------------------

### Did not graduate from college

* George Washington (The death of Washington's father ended his formal schooling. The College of William \& Mary issued surveying licenses in Virginia, and Washington received his license from the College in 1749 — surveyors did not attend classes at the school. Washington believed strongly in formal education, and his will left money and/or stocks to support three educational institutions, including George Washington University and Washington and Lee University)
* James Monroe (attended the College of William and Mary, but dropped out to fight in the Revolutionary War)
* Andrew Jackson
* Martin Van Buren
* William Henry Harrison (attended Hampden Sydney College for three years but did not graduate and then attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine but never received a degree)
* Zachary Taylor
* Millard Fillmore (founded the University at Buffalo)
* Abraham Lincoln (had only about a year of formal schooling of any kind)
* Andrew Johnson (no formal schooling of any kind)
* Grover Cleveland
* William McKinley (attended Allegheny College, but did not graduate; also attended Albany Law School, but also did not graduate)
* Harry S. Truman (went to business college and law school, but did not graduate)

4. **^** Known as the University of North Carolina until 1963\. Since 1972, the "University of North Carolina" name has applied to the state's public university system.

Some presidents attended more than one institution. George Washington never attended college, though The College of William \& Mary did issue him a surveyor's certificate. One president attended a foreign college at the undergraduate level: John Quincy Adams at Leiden University (John F. Kennedy intended to study at the London School of Economics, but failed to attend as he fell ill before classes began.) Bill Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship, enrolling at the University of Oxford in Fall 1968, where he read for a B.Phil in politics. He left Oxford without earning a degree in order to enroll at Yale Law School. 

Three presidents have attended the United States Service academies: Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, while Jimmy Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. No presidents have graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy or the much newer U.S. Air Force Academy. Eisenhower also graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College, Army Industrial College and Army War College. These were not degree-granting institutions when Eisenhower attended, but were part of his professional education as a career soldier.

### Graduate school

A total of 21 presidents attended some form of graduate school (including professional schools). Among them, eleven presidents received a graduate degree during their lifetimes; two more received graduate degrees posthumously.
