The station became a junction with the opening of the line to Carmyle and Kirkhill on 1 February 1897\\. Westbound services ran to Stobcross, from where they could proceed to Possil via Maryhill Central, Partickhill and points north via the connection to the Stobcross Railway or on to the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway to Dumbarton and Balloch Central via Partick Central \\& Dalmuir Riverside.\n\nIn 1956 the line was re-signalled with colour light signals controlled from the re-equipped signal boxes at Bridgeton Cross Junction and Stobcross Junction. However, the station was closed along with both lines on 5 October 1964 as a result of the Beeching Axe. The tracks were subsequently lifted, but the station and tunnels were left intact.\n\nAs part of the Argyle Line project, the Rutherglen line platforms reopened as **Bridgeton Station** on 5 November 1979, as offering regular commuter services into Central Station (low level) and on towards the western suburbs.\n\nIn preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the station underwent substantial renovations in 2010\\.\n\nAccidents and incidents\n-----------------------\n\n* On 2 February 1929, a passenger train was diverted into the bay platform due to a signalman's error. Several people were injured when the train crashed through the buffers.\n\nServices\n--------\n\n### 1979\n\nWhen the Argyle Line was opened in 1979, there were six trains an hour to the Hamilton Circle, from Dalmuir, with two services an hour going as far west as Dumbarton Central.
