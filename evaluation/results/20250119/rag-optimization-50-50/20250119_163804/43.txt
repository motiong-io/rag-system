Question: As of 2023, how many more employees does the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P500 have than the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P500?
Ground truth: 8,350
log:

Generated answer: The company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 is A (Agilent Technologies, but more likely it is 'A' from AAL, which is American Airlines, or 'AA' from Alcoa, which was replaced by 'AAP' from Advance Auto Parts in the S&P 500), but based on available information it seems that the company with the ticker symbol 'A' that is in the S&P 500 does not exist. 

However, if we take a look at other stocks that start with "A", such as "AA" (Alcoa) being replaced by "AAP" (Advance Auto Parts), we can check other companies like American Airlines ("AAL"), Agilent ("A"), or Advance Auto Parts ("AAP"). But for this example let's consider "AAL".

The second to last company alphabetically by ticker symbol would be "ZTS" (Zoetis).

According to available data:

- American Airlines has around 123,600 employees.
- Zoetis has around 12,300 employees.

So American Airlines has approximately 111,300 more employees than Zoetis.

Check result: N
