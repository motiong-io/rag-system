It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906\\). In 1905 they added the indigenous word \"Woomballano\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to *The Women's Art Club* in 1913 then to the *Melbourne Society of Women Painters* in 1930\\. The present designation was adopted in 1954\\.\n\nMany of its early members were plein air painters and identified with the Heidelberg School, which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the decorative arts at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the Meldrum tonal school and modernism, being invited to join. The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The Society of Women Painters (later named Women\u2019s Industrial Arts Society) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies. During the Second World War the MSWPS opened volunteer headquarters at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.\n\nMSWPS has met at heritage-listed Ola Cohn House 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964\\. She was President of the Society from 1948 to 1964\\.\n\nNotable members\n---------------\n\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors members included:\n\n* Cristina Asquith Baker, painter, print-maker (1868\u20131960\\)\n* Alice Marian Ellen Bale (1875\u20131955\\), Studied at National Gallery School 1895\u20131904, from 1917 to 1955 a consistent exhibitor with the Women\u2019s Art Club \n* Margaret Francis Ellen Baskerville sculptor (1861\u20131930\\)\n* Clarice Beckett (1887\u20131935\\) participated in Women\u2019s Art Club shows until the early 1930s.\n* Lina Bryans (1909\u20132000\\), exhibited 1940\u20131965 and prominent in the 1960s, resigned 1966, rejoined 1991\u2014.
