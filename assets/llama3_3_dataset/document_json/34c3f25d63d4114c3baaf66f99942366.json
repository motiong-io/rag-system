The school serves as a Visual and Performing Arts Magnet and Center for International Studies magnet for Orange County Public Schools.\n\nThe school's first principal, Bill Spoone, went on to be elected to the Orange County School Board. The football stadium is named after him. The school's gymnasium is named after its second principal, Larry Payne, and is nicknamed \"The House of Payne.\"\n\nThe school opened with enrollment above capacity and began using portable classrooms on the North Campus, formerly known as the 9th Grade Center. Due to overflow from main campus, many non-freshman classes were moved into additional portable classrooms at the 9th Grade Center, which was renamed North Campus, with the main campus renamed the South Campus. Portable classrooms are still used on the North Campus and are primarily for freshman-level classes.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nSince the 2022-2023 school year, most of the portables have been shut down, due to the aging conditions and the possibility of a future renovation. In October 2024, construction workers began to destroy or transport the portables, and most of the area is now rubble and construction sand. As of December 2024, only around eight portables currently remain, awaiting to be destroyed or transported.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nAs of the 2014\u201315 school year the school had 3,641 students, of whom 35% were white, 32% African American, 24% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and 2% multiracial.\n\nThe school underwent a series of renovations which finished in 2015\\. A new building has been added, along with new VPA classrooms on the South Campus.\n\nAthletics\n---------\n\nThe press box at Bill Spoone Stadium is dedicated to Mike Murray, \"The Voice of the Panthers\" since the school opened its doors in 1987\\. A full-time employee of a large aerospace contractor and not formally employed by the school, Murray was elected to their Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001\\.\n\nThe school's baseball facility is John Barbati Field. In 1992, the baseball facilities were completely renovated with a state of the art press box, team office and facilities. The new facilities were designed and constructed by William P. Riegert, CEO of Cox Associates, Architects, and donated to the OC School Board in a dedication ceremony on February 22, 1992\\. Accepting for the OC School Board were Assistant Superintendent Dave Wofford, Assistant Superintendent Dave Sojourner, Superintendent Don Shaw, Bill Spoone, and Bill Thompson. Today the Press Box is dedicated to Scott Muhlhann, a baseball player and 1992 school valedictorian who died of cancer in 1998\\.\n\nThe mascot for Dr. Phillips is the Panther; specifically, the Florida panther. They have many sports including lacrosse, football, baseball, golf, basketball and swimming. The Panthers have won FHSAA state championships in the following sports:\n\n* Football (2017\\)\n* Baseball (1996\\)\n* Men's Basketball (2021\\)\n* Women's Basketball (1992, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2022, 2023, 2024\\)\n* Men's Golf (1990, 1991, 1997, 1999\\)\n* Women's Golf (1993, 1994\\)\n* Men's Swimming \\& Diving (1995\\)\n* Women's Swimming \\& Diving (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998\\)\n* Competitive Cheerleading (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2020\\)\n* Women's Flag Football (2011\\)\n\nAthletic program accomplishments:\n\n* FHSAA State All-Sports Award - 2012-13\n* FHSAA State All-Sports Award - 2010-11\n* FHSAA State All-Sports Award - 1998-99\\[*citation needed*]\n* FHSAA State All-Sports Award - 1995-96\\[*citation needed*]\n\nNotable alumni\n--------------\n\n|  | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.
