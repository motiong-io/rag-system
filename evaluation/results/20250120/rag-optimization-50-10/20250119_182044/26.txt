        What are the dates of all the blue moons that occurred between the beginning of World War I (July 28, 1914) and the end of World War II (September 2, 1945)?:
Based on the provided table, the blue moons that occurred between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945 are:

1. November 21, 1915 (Maine rule)
2. August 22, 1918 (Maine rule and Astro-Seasonal rule)
3. January 31, 1915 (Pruett's definition is not applicable here as it was introduced later)
4. March 31, 1915 (Pruett's definition is not applicable here as it was introduced later)
5. August 24, 1915 (Astro-Seasonal rule)

Additionally:

6. May 21, 1921 
7. February   - never mind these dates are outside of our range.

However I can see some other relevant ones:
8. November   - never mind this date too
9. Janurary   - same thing 

Let me recheck my sources: 

10. August    - same thing again

After reviewing all tables I have access to regarding blue moon data between those years I found a few more:
11/21/1934,
08/22/1937,
05/21/1940

Which blue moon dates fall on the 31st day of a month between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945?:
Based on the provided tables, the blue moon dates that fall on the 31st day of a month between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945 are:

* January 31, 1915 (Pruett rule)
* March 31, 1915 (Pruett rule)
* October 31, 1925 
* January 31 is not mentioned for any year between these dates except for the year of '15.
* March and October are also only mentioned once in this date range.

How many blue moons occurred on the 31st day of a month between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945?:
According to the text, there were 187 full moons that could be called "blue" by some definition between 1819 and 1962. However, it does not provide a specific count of blue moons that occurred on the 31st day of a month between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945.

To answer this question accurately would require access to historical lunar data or a detailed calendar of blue moons for the specified period. The provided text does not contain this specific information.


        


Generated answer: Based on the observations, I can see that there are a few blue moons that occurred between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945. Using the Pruett rule, I found that the following blue moons occurred on the 31st day of a month:

1. January 31, 1915
2. March 31, 1915
3. October 31, 1925

There are no other mentions of blue moons occurring on the 31st day of a month within this time period using the Pruett rule. Therefore, according to my observations, there were at least **3** blue moons that occurred on the **31st** of a month between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945.

Check result: N
