To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Subtract 1963 from 2009:
2009 - 1963 = 46

2. Determine the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024:
As of my knowledge cutoff, France has 18 administrative regions (13 in metropolitan France and 5 overseas regions). Assuming this number hasn't changed as of January 1, 2024, we will use 18.

3. Multiply the result from step 1 by the number of administrative regions:
46 * 18 = 828

So, the result would be 828.
