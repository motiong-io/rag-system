        What are the dates of all the blue moons that occurred between the beginning of World War I (July 28, 1914) and the end of World War II (September 2, 1945)?:
Based on the provided table, the blue moons that occurred between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945, are:

* January 31, 1915 (Pruett rule)
* March 31, 1915 (Pruett rule)
* November 21, 1915 (Maine rule and Almanac)
* August 22, 1918 (Maine rule and Almanac)
* May 21, 1921 (Maine rule and Almanac)
* February 20, 1924 (Maine rule and Almanac)
* November 21, 1934 
* August 22, 1937 
* May have additional dates not included in this specific table.

Which blue moons occurred between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II?:
Based on the provided text, between the beginning of World War I (1914) and the end of World War II (1945), some blue moons that occurred are:

1. 21 November 1915
2. 22 August 1918
3. 21 May 1921
4. 20 February 1924
5. 21 November 1934
6. 22 August 1937
7. 21 May 1940

These dates are mentioned in the text as examples of blue moons that occurred during this time period, according to the "Maine rule" definition of a blue moon, which is based on the occurrence of four full moons in a season.

What are the dates of all the blue moons that occurred between the beginning of World War I (July 28, 1914) and the end of World War II (September 2, 1945) using the Pruett rule?:
Based on the provided text, the Pruett rule defines a blue moon as the second full moon in a calendar month. The table provided in the text lists the blue moon dates and times from 1901 to 1925, and also from 2083 to 2100, according to different rules (Pruett, Maine, and Astro-Seasonal). 

To answer your question, we need to look at the table that lists blue moon dates from 1901 to 1925. Since World War I started on July 28, 1914, and World War II ended on September 2, 1945, we are interested in the period between these two dates.

From the table provided for the years between 1901 and 1925 that fall within our time frame of interest (1914-1945), we can identify several blue moons using the Pruett rule:

* January 31, 1915
* March 31, 1915
* September 30, 1917
* July 30, 1920
* April 30, 1923
* October is not within our range of interest for this portion of data.

However it seems there might be more data needed for an accurate answer as only data up until year of '1925' has been given.


        


Generated answer: Based on the provided information, using the Pruett rule, we can identify two blue moons that occurred on the 31st of the month between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II:

1. January 31, 1915
2. March 31, 1915

Additionally, we also have:
3. July 31 is not mentioned in our data but 
4. October 31 is not within our range of interest for this portion of data.

However it seems there might be more data needed for an accurate answer as only data up until year of '1925' has been given.

But based on what we have so far, at least two blue moons occurred on the 31st of the month during this time period.

Check result: N
