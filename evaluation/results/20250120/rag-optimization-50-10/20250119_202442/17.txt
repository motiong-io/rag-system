Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to find the U.S. state capital city that meets two conditions:

1. The city is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference.
2. The mayor of the city attended the same university as at least one U.S. president.

From the provided observations, we know that the U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference are:

1. Austin, Texas
2. Lincoln, Nebraska
3. Columbia, Missouri (note: Columbia is not the capital of Missouri, but we can consider Jefferson City, which is the capital of Missouri)
4. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

We also know that the University of Texas at Austin is located in Austin, Texas, and it is an outgoing member of the Big 12 Conference.

Additionally, we know that the mayor of Austin, Texas in August 2024 is Kirk, and he attended the University of Texas at Austin.

The University of Texas at Austin is also the alma mater of several U.S. politicians, but none of them are directly mentioned in the provided observations.

However, since Kirk, the mayor of Austin, Texas, attended the University of Texas at Austin, and given that there are no other direct connections mentioned between mayors and universities attended by U.S. presidents in the other cities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Jefferson City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), we can infer that Kirk is likely the correct answer.

So, in August 2024, the first name of the mayor of the U.S. state capital city who attended the same university as at least one U.S. president (although not directly confirmed) and whose city is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference is Kirk.
