1. Find out the name of the stadium where the oldest extant football team in Italy plays.
2. Find out who the stadium is named after.
3. Determine the birth year of the person the stadium is named after.

From the given observations:
- The oldest extant football team in Italy is Genoa Cricket and Football Club.

Now, we need to find out the birth year of Luigi Ferraris. Although the exact birth year of Luigi Ferraris is not provided in the observations, we can find this information through external knowledge: Luigi Ferraris was born in 1887.

Next, we calculate the year when Luigi Ferraris was 5 years old: 1887 + 5 = 1892.

Therefore, the emperor of China when Luigi Ferraris was 5 years old was Guangxu.
