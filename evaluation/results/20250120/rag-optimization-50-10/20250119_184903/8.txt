What is the largest ward in the country of Monaco?:
The largest ward in Monaco is Monte Carlo, which covers an area of 436,760 square meters and accounts for 21.5% of the country's total area.

How many people had walked on the moon as of 1970?:
As of 1970, a total of 6 people had walked on the moon, during the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. 

1. Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11)
2. Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin (Apollo 11)
3. Pete Conrad (Apollo 12)
4. Alan Bean (Apollo 12)

However, if we consider the subsequent missions up to 1970, we should also include:

5. Alan Shepard (Apollo 14 was launched in January 1971, but I'm assuming you are asking up to the end of 1970)
6. Edgar Mitchell (Apollo 14 was launched in January 1971, but I'm assuming you are asking up to the end of 1970)

But since Apollo 13 did not land on the moon due to an accident and Apollo 14 launched in 1971, as of December 1970 only the first two missions had landed on the moon.

So as of December 1970, a total of six people had not walked on the moon yet from these subsequent missions, only from Apollo 11 and Apollo 12.

Therefore as of December 1970 only four people had walked on the moon from these two missions: 

1. Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11)
2. Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin (Apollo 11)
3. Pete Conrad (Apollo 12)
4. Alan Bean (Apollo 12)

What is the General Motors vehicle named after the largest ward in Monaco, which is Monte Carlo?:
The Chevrolet Monte Carlo


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps.

First, we know that the General Motors vehicle is named after the largest ward in Monaco, which is Monte Carlo. The vehicle is the Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

Next, we need to find out the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo was first introduced in 1970 as a 1970 model.

Now, we need to determine how many people had walked on the moon as of the 1970 model year. Since the 1970 model year refers to cars produced for 1970, and considering that these cars would have been available in late 1969 or early 1970, we should look at how many people had walked on the moon up to that point.

As of December 1969, only two missions had successfully landed on the moon: Apollo 11 and Apollo 12. 

From Apollo 11:
1. Neil Armstrong
2. Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin

From Apollo 12:
3. Pete Conrad
4. Alan Bean

Therefore, as of the first model year (1970) of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, a total of four people had walked on the moon.
