        obersevations:
        In what state is the US capitol located?:
The US Capitol is located in Washington, D.C., which is not a state but a federal district. It is not part of any state, but rather a separate entity that serves as the capital of the United States.

In what year did Punxsutawney Phil start making predictions, and what is his birth year or age?:
According to the text, Punxsutawney Phil's predictions started in 1887. However, it is claimed that Phil has been making predictions since 1886 and that he has lived to make weather prognostications since then, sustained by drinks of "groundhog punch" or "elixir of life". 

The text does not provide a specific birth year for Punxsutawney Phil, but it mentions that the lifespan of a groundhog in the wild is roughly six years. This implies that Phil's age would be unusually old if he were a real groundhog, but according to the lore, he has been alive and making predictions for over 130 years.

In what state or district is the US capitol located?:
The US Capitol is located in Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia).


        


Generated answer: To determine how many years earlier Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol, we need to consider the location of Punxsutawney Phil and the US Capitol.

Punxsutawney Phil is located in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, while the US Capitol is located in Washington, D.C. Since Washington, D.C. is not a state, but rather a federal district, we need to consider if Punxsutawney Phil has ever made a prediction in a state that encompasses or is adjacent to Washington, D.C.

The states adjacent to Washington, D.C. are Maryland and Virginia. If Punxsutawney Phil were to make a prediction in either of these states, it would be in the same general region as the US Capitol.

Punxsutawney Phil's predictions started in 1887, and he is located in Pennsylvania. To have made a prediction in the same state as the US Capitol (if it were in a state), or more specifically, in a state adjacent to Washington, D.C., we would need to consider how many years earlier he would have to be alive to have made a prediction in Maryland or Virginia.

However, there is no information provided about Punxsutawney Phil making predictions outside of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. But if we were to assume he made a prediction in Maryland, for example, we would need to know when the first recorded groundhog day prediction was made in that state.

Since there is no information provided about the first Groundhog Day prediction in Maryland or Virginia, let's assume that Punxsutawney Phil would have to be alive during a time when the US Capitol was still in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (from 1774 to 1800) to have made a prediction in the same state as the US capitol.

The US Capitol was in Philadelphia from 1774 to 1800, and Punxsutawney Phil's predictions started in 1887. Therefore, Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive at least 87 years earlier (1887 - 1800) to have made a prediction during the time the US Capitol was still in Pennsylvania. However, if we consider the entire time the US Capitol was in Philadelphia (1774-1800), he would have to be alive at least 113 years earlier (1887 - 1774) to have made a prediction in the same state as the US capitol during that time.
