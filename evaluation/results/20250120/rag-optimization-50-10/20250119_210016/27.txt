        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
The text does not explicitly state the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Chelsea FC used a traditional numbering system during this period, where players wore numbers 1-11 based on their position on the field.

In the 1928 match at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea used a numbering system where:

* 1. Goalkeeper
* 2. Right full back
* 3. Left full back
* 4. Right half back
* 5. Centre half back
* 6. Left half back
* 7. Outside right
* 8. Inside right
* 9. Centre forward
* 10. Inside left
* 11. Outside left

Although this system was used in 1928, it is likely that Chelsea FC continued to use a similar traditional numbering system during the years 1945 to 1947, as there is no mention of them using persistent squad numbers or any other numbering system during this period.

What position or role did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC, to determine the corresponding squad number?:
Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC. In a traditional 4-4-2 system, which was common during his time, the squad numbers 1-11 would usually have been assigned to players in the following positions:

* 1: Goalkeeper
* 2: Right-back
* 3: Left-back
* 4: Centre-back
* 5: Centre-back
* 6: Central midfielder
* 7: Right midfielder
* 8: Central midfielder
* 9: Centre-forward
* 10: Striker/Attacking midfielder
* 11: Left midfielder

Based on this system, as a centre-forward, Tommy Lawton would likely have worn the number 9 shirt for Chelsea FC.


        


Generated answer: Based on the traditional numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947, and considering Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward, it is likely that he would have worn the number 9 shirt for Chelsea FC.
