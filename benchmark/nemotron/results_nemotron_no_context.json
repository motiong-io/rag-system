    "Question": "If my future wife has the same first name as the 15th first lady of the United States' mother and her surname is the same as the second assassinated president's mother's maiden name, what is my future wife's name? ",
    "Answer": "Jane Ballou",
    "Result": "To solve this multi-hop question, we'll break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the 15th First Lady of the United States:**\n   The 15th President of the United States was James Buchanan. Since he remained a bachelor throughout his life, there was no First Lady during his presidency. However, to proceed with the question, let's consider the 15th First Lady in the general list of First Ladies. \n   The list of U.S. Presidents with their corresponding First Ladies is as follows:\n   1. George Washington - Martha Washington\n   2. John Adams - Abigail Adams\n   3. Thomas Jefferson - Dolley Madison (hostess, as Jefferson was a widower)\n   4. James Madison - Dolley Madison\n   5.

Millard Fillmore - Abigail Fillmore\n   14. Franklin Pierce - Jane Means Appleton Pierce\n   15. James Buchanan (no First Lady, as mentioned earlier)\n\n   To proceed, let's consider the 15th 'First Lady' in a broader sense, which would be the wife of the 14th President or the hostess for the 15th President. Since James Buchanan didn't have a First Lady, we'll use the 14th President's wife for this question:\n   The 14th President was Franklin Pierce, and his wife (the 14th First Lady) was Jane Means Appleton Pierce.\n\n   **Jane Means Appleton Pierce's mother:** \n   Jane Means Appleton's mother was Elizabeth Means Appleton. \n   **First name of the 15th First Lady's mother (or in this case, the 14th First Lady's mother):** \n   Elizabeth\n\n2. **Identify the second assassinated President of the United States:**\n   The list of assassinated U.S. Presidents is as follows:\n   1.

    "Answer": "37th",
    "Result": "To answer this multi-hop question, we'll break it down into steps:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Charlotte Bronte book published in 1847**\nThe book published in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte is \"Jane Eyre\".\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Dewey Decimal Classification for \"Jane Eyre\"**\nThe Dewey Decimal Classification for \"Jane Eyre\" is 823.8 (English fiction, 19th century). However, please note that Dewey Decimal Classification can vary slightly depending on the edition or the library. For the sake of this problem, we'll use 823.8 as the height in feet.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the height of Bronte Tower (823.8 feet) to the tallest buildings in New York City (as of August 2024)**\nHere's a list of the top 10 tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024 (subject to change, but based on available data):\n\n1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet\n2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet\n3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet\n4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet\n5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet\n6. 30 Hudson Yards - 1,296 feet\n7. Empire State Building - 1,250 feet\n8. Bank of America Tower - 1,200 feet\n9. Chrysler Building - 1,047 feet\n10. New York Times Building - 1,046 feet\n\n**Step 4: Rank Bronte Tower among the tallest buildings in New York City**\nBased on the height of 823.8 feet, Bronte Tower would not be among the top 10 tallest buildings in New York City. To provide a more accurate ranking, let's look at the next tier of buildings:\n\n- 4 Times Square (Conde Nast Building) - 809 feet\n- One Penn Plaza - 750 feet\n- 425 5th Avenue - 734 feet\n\nConsidering these, Bronte Tower (823.8 feet) would likely rank around 11th or 12th among the tallest buildings in New York City, as of August 2024.

    "Question": "How many years earlier would Punxsutawney Phil have to be canonically alive to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol?",
    "Answer": "87",
    "Result": "To solve this multi-hop question, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the location of the US Capitol**: The US Capitol is located in Washington, D.C.\n2. **Identify the state where Punxsutawney Phil makes his predictions**: Punxsutawney Phil makes his predictions in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.\n3. **Determine if there's a historical connection or alternative location for Phil in the same state as the US Capitol**: Since there's no direct connection between Punxsutawney Phil and Washington, D.C., we'll assume the question is asking for a hypothetical scenario where Phil makes a prediction in the same state (Maryland or Virginia, as D.C. is not a state, but surrounded by these two). However, for the sake of this question, let's consider the broader region, including the state of Maryland, which is closer to D.C. and has a similar climate.\n\nNow, assuming we want Phil to make a prediction in Maryland (to be in the same general region as the US Capitol):\n\n4. **Establish the starting year for Punxsutawney Phil's predictions**: According to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Punxsutawney Phil's first prediction was in 1887.\n5. **Find a historical groundhog day-like event or a notable weather prediction in Maryland (around the same region as the US Capitol) before 1887**: One notable event is the 'Great Blizzard of 1857' or the 'Great Blizzard of 1857 in the Mid-Atlantic,' but there isn't a specific 'groundhog day' event. However, for the sake of this question, let's consider a more general weather prediction or event.\n\nConsidering the lack of a specific 'groundhog day' event in Maryland before 1887, let's use the 'Great Blizzard of 1857' as a reference point for a significant weather event in the region. This blizzard occurred on January 7-8, 1857.\n\n6. **Calculate the years earlier**: \n   - Starting year of Phil's predictions: 1887\n   - Reference year for the weather event in Maryland: 1857\n   - Years earlier: 1887 - 1857 = 30 years\n\nSo, Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive **30 years earlier** (in 1857) to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same general region as the US Capitol (Maryland).",

As of August 3, 2024, how many times would the tallest building in San Francisco fit end to end from the bottom of the New Britain Trench to the surface of the ocean? The answer should be a rounded-off whole number.   ",
    "Answer": "28",
    "Result": "To answer this, we need to know:\n\n1. The depth of the trench James Cameron explored (it was actually the Mariana Trench, not the New Britain Trench, on March 26, 2012, not March 7th)\n2. The height of the tallest building in San Francisco\n3. The New Britain Trench's depth (since that's the one asked about)\n\nAssuming corrections:\n- James Cameron explored the Mariana Trench, but we'll use the New Britain Trench for the calculation.\n- The New Britain Trench's depth is approximately 9,000 meters (29,527 ft).\n- The tallest building in San Francisco is the Salesforce Tower, with a height of approximately 326 meters (1,070 ft).\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n- Depth of the New Britain Trench: 9,000 meters\n- Height of the Salesforce Tower: 326 meters\n\nNumber of times the tower fits end to end from the bottom to the surface:\n9,000 meters / 326 meters ≈ 27.6\n\nRounded off to the nearest whole number: **28**",
