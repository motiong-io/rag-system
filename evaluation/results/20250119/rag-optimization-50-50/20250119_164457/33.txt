        obersevations:
        What is the name of the magazine that serialized the manga series Raw Hero?:
The magazine that serialized the manga series "Raw Hero" is "Evening", a Japanese seinen manga magazine published by Kodansha.

What is the name of the publishing company of the magazine "Evening"?:
The publishing company of the magazine "Evening" is Kodansha.

Who is the founder of Kodansha?:
The founder of Kodansha is Seiji Noma.

How old would Seiji Noma have been in the year the magazine "Evening" ended publication?:
Seiji Noma was born in 1878 and died in 1938. The magazine "Evening" ended publication in 2023. To calculate Seiji Noma's age in 2023, we need to subtract his birth year from 2023 and then consider that he passed away in 1938.

2023 - 1878 = 145 years

However, since Seiji Noma passed away in 1938, he would not have been alive in 2023. If we were to calculate his age if he were still alive:

145 years old

But again, this is purely hypothetical as Seiji Noma had already passed away by then.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps. 

First, we need to identify the magazine that serialized the manga series "Raw Hero". According to our knowledge, it is "Evening", a Japanese seinen manga magazine.

Next, we determine the publishing company of the magazine "Evening", which is Kodansha.

Then, we find out who the founder of Kodansha is. The founder of Kodansha is Seiji Noma.

Finally, considering that Seiji Noma was born in 1878 and died in 1938, and given that the magazine "Evening" ended publication in 2023 (although this specific information about its end year wasn't directly provided for calculation purposes initially), if Seiji Noma were alive:

2023 - 1878 = 145 years old

However, since Seiji Noma passed away in 1938, he would not have been alive in 2023. This age calculation is purely hypothetical as he had already passed away by then.
