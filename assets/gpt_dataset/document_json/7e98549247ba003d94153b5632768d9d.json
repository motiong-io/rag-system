The new organisation with \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez as technical director completely miscued its signings, with neither Jesper Blomqvist, Edgar Davids, Christophe Dugarry or Michael Reiziger being successful. After a Supercoppa Italiana defeat against Fiorentina at home at the San Siro, a 2\u20133 loss at Piacenza for the league cost the Uruguayan his position. Tabarez was replaced by former championship winning coach Arrigo Sacchi, the change did not happen and days later due to a 2\u20131 defeat to Rosenborg at home in the Champions League the team was not qualified to Quarterfinals. The *Rossoneri* eventually finished 11th managed to save the reigning champions' contract in Serie A by just six points.\n\nThe miserable season also prompted captain Franco Baresi to end his active career, with Milan retiring the \\#6 shirt in his honour.\n\nSquad\n-----\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Weah said he exploded in frustration after putting up with racist tauntings from Costa during both of the teams' Champions League matches that autumn. Costa strenuously denied the accusations of racism and was not charged by UEFA as no witnesses could verify Weah's allegations, not even his Milan teammates. Weah later attempted to apologise to Costa but this was rebuffed by the Portuguese, who considered the charges of racist insults leveled against him to be defamatory and took Weah to court. The incident led to Costa undergoing facial surgery and he was subsequently sidelined for three weeks.* | | | | |\n\n| 4 December 1996 6 | **Milan** | **1\u20132** | **Rosenborg** | Milan |\n| --- |

The new organisation with \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez as technical director completely miscued its signings, with neither Jesper Blomqvist, Edgar Davids, Christophe Dugarry or Michael Reiziger being successful. After a Supercoppa Italiana defeat against Fiorentina at home at the San Siro, a 2\u20133 loss at Piacenza for the league cost the Uruguayan his position. Tabarez was replaced by former championship winning coach Arrigo Sacchi, the change did not happen and days later due to a 2\u20131 defeat to Rosenborg at home in the Champions League the team was not qualified to Quarterfinals. The *Rossoneri* eventually finished 11th managed to save the reigning champions' contract in Serie A by just six points.\n\nThe miserable season also prompted captain Franco Baresi to end his active career, with Milan retiring the \\#6 shirt in his honour.\n\nSquad\n-----", "contextualized_text": "The chunk provides a summary of the challenges faced by AC Milan during the 1996\u201397 season, including managerial changes, poor signings, and the team's overall performance, along with notable events such as the retirement of captain Franco Baresi.
