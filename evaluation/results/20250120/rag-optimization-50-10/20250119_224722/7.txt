Generated answer: To answer this question, I need to make some connections. The artist who released the album "Father of Asahd" is DJ Khaled. However, I don't have information about which high school DJ Khaled attended. But, as of the new information, I know that DJ Khaled went to the same high school as an Olympic diver. 

Unfortunately, I don't have information about which high school DJ Khaled attended or the name of the Olympic diver. If I had more information about the high school or the Olympic diver, I could try to find the answer to your question about the number of Olympic teams the diver participated on.
