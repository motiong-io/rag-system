Generated answer: To solve this, we need to know the number of times the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl as of 2010. Although this information isn't provided in the given observations, I can tell you that as of 2010, the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl 5 times.

Now, let's calculate the result:
- Brazil had won the World Cup 5 times.
- The Chicago Bulls had won the NBA Championship 6 times.
- The sum of these two is 5 + 6 = 11.
- Multiplying this sum by the number of times the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl (5) gives us 11 * 5 = 55.

So, as of 2010, you would be left with 55.
