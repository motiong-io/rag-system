3. Norman - with a population of 128,026 (although this is slightly above 100,000 but still meets the criteria)
4. Broken Arrow - does not meet this criteria as its population was reported at 113,540 in one context but another context had it below 100k for the year 2010.

So there are at least two cities (Oklahoma City and Tulsa) that have more than 100,000 residents and possibly Norman depending on how you want to interpret "at least".

Generated answer: To find the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census, we need to look at the populations of Oklahoma City, Tulsa, and Norman according to the 1990 United States census.

The population of Oklahoma City in 1990 was 444,719.
The population of Tulsa in 1990 was 367,302.
The population of Norman in 1990 was 80,071.

However, since Norman's population was less than 100,000 in 2020 is not a condition for this question but rather it had more than that so we should include it. 

So the total population would be: 
444,719 (Oklahoma City) + 367,302 (Tulsa) + 80,071 (Norman) = 
892,092

Therefore, according to the provided contexts and calculations based on those contexts for cities with more than or equal to a hundred thousand residents by year twenty-twenty. The answer is: The total population is approximately eight hundred ninety-two thousand ninety-two.

Check result: N
