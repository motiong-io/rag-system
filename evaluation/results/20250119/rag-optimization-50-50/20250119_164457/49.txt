Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to combine the information from the given observations.

The U.S. president who won Alaska is Lyndon B. Johnson.
The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald R. Ford.

Since these are two different presidents, we need to find out which one of them matches all the criteria mentioned in the question.

Lyndon B. Johnson won Alaska but did not graduate from Yale University and have a son named Michael.
Gerald R. Ford graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael but did not win Alaska (as it was already won by Lyndon B. Johnson).

However, considering that Gerald R. Ford matches two out of three criteria (graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael), let's look at his middle name: The middle name of Gerald R. Ford is Rudolph.

So, as of 2024, at the time of his birth, the middle name of the U.S. president who comes closest to matching all these criteria would be Rudolph (since he matches two out of three).

Check result: N
