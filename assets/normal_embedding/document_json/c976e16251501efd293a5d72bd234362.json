All eight members of the former Big Eight Conference joined with half the members of the former Southwest Conference (Texas, Texas A\\&M, Baylor and Texas Tech) to form the conference, with play beginning in 1996\\.\n\nThe Big 12 does not claim the Big Eight's history as its own, even though it was essentially the Big Eight plus four of the Texas universities.\n\nThe Big 12 began athletic play in fall 1996, with the Texas Tech vs. Kansas State football game being the first-ever sports event staged by the conference.\n\nFrom its formation until 2011, its 12 members competed in two divisions in most sports. The two Oklahoma universities and the four Texas universities formed the South Division, while the other six universities of the former Big Eight formed the North Division.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2012 four charter members left the conference:\n\n* Colorado\n* Missouri\n* Nebraska\n* Texas A\\&M\n\nIn 2012, two universities joined the conference:\n\n* TCU\n* West Virginia\n\nOn July 26, 2021, Oklahoma and Texas notified the Big 12 Conference that the two universities did not wish to extend their grant of television rights beyond the 2024\u201325 athletic year. On July 27, 2021, Oklahoma and Texas sent a joint letter to the Southeastern Conference requesting an invitation for membership beginning July 1, 2025\\. On July 29, 2021, the 14 presidents and chancellors of SEC member universities voted unanimously to invite Oklahoma and Texas to join the SEC. The following day, the Texas Board of Regents and Oklahoma Board of Regents each accepted the invitation to join the SEC from July 1, 2025\\.\n\nOn September 10, 2021, the Big 12 announced that invitations had been extended to and accepted by BYU (a football independent and member of the non-football West Coast Conference) and three members of the American Athletic Conference in Cincinnati, UCF, and Houston. These moves, combined with the impending departure of Oklahoma and Texas, would once again increase the Big 12's membership to twelve schools. All four schools began competing in Big 12 athletics beginning in summer of 2023\\. BYU had initially announced that it would join in 2023, and Houston indicated it could do so as well. On June 10, 2022, The American and its three departing members announced a buyout agreement that allowed those schools to join the Big 12 in 2023\\.\n\nOn February 9, 2023, Oklahoma and Texas announced they had reached a settlement with the conference that allowed them to join the SEC on July 1, 2024\\.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, Colorado, a former member of the Big 12, announced it would rejoin the conference from the Pac-12 beginning in the 2024\u201325 academic year. The following week, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah announced they would leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, also effective for the 2024\u201325 academic year.\n\nDistinctive elements\n--------------------\n\n### Population base and markets\n\nThe largest media markets represented by the Big 12 are, ranked nationally:\n\n* Dallas-Fort Worth (5th)\n* Houston (6th)\n* Phoenix (11th)\n* Orlando (16th)\n* Denver (17th)\n* Salt Lake City (27th)\n* San Antonio (31st)\n* Kansas City (34th)\n* Cincinnati (37th)\n* Oklahoma City (47th)\n* Tulsa (62nd)\n* Tucson (65th)\n* Des Moines (67th)\n* Wichita (72nd)\n\nAlthough West Virginia University is based out of Morgantown, West Virginia (officially part of the Pittsburgh (26th) media market), the TV market encompasses the majority of West Virginia's TV viewership and also reaches well into Western Pennsylvania.\n\nKansas State University is in Manhattan, Kansas, which is part of the Topeka, Kansas media market, but it is close to the Wichita market, which encompasses two-thirds of the state (stretching to the border with Colorado), including the cities of Dodge City, Garden City, Hutchinson and Salina.\n\nWhile the University of Kansas is in Lawrence, Kansas, it has close proximity to the Kansas City television market, increasing the base into western Missouri.\n\n| State | Population | Universities |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Arizona | 7,431,344 | \\* **University of Arizona** \\* **Arizona State University** |\n| Colorado | 5,773,714 | \\* **University of Colorado Boulder** |\n| Florida | 22,610,726 | \\* **University of Central Florida** |\n| Iowa | 3,207,004 | \\* **Iowa State University** |\n| Kansas | 2,940,546 | \\* **University of Kansas**\\* **Kansas State University** |\n| Ohio | 11,785,935 | \\* **University of Cincinnati** |\n| Oklahoma | 4,053,824 | \\* **Oklahoma State University** |\n| Texas | 30,503,301 | \\* **Baylor University**\\* **University of Houston**\\* **Texas Christian University**\\* **Texas Tech University** |\n| Utah | 3,417,734 | \\* **Brigham Young University** \\* University of Utah |\n| West Virginia | 1,770,071 | \\* **West Virginia University** |\n| Total | 93,494,199 |  |\n\n\\* **Arizona State University**\n\n\\* University of Utah\n\n### Grant of Rights\n\nMember universities granted their first and second tier sports media rights to the conference for the length of their current TV deals. The Grant of Rights (GOR) deal with the leagues' TV contracts ensures that \"if a Big 12 school leaves for another league in the next 13 years, that school's media rights, including revenue, would remain with the Big 12 and not its new conference\".\n\nGOR is seen by league members as a \"foundation of stability\" and allowed the Big 12 to be \"positioned with one of the best media rights arrangements in collegiate sports, providing the conference and its members unprecedented revenue growth, and sports programming over two networks.\" All members agreed to the GOR and later agreed to extend the initial 6-year deal to 13 years to correspond to the length of their TV contracts.\n\nPrior to this agreement, the Big Ten and Pac-12 also had similar GOR agreements. The Big 12 subsequently assisted the ACC in drafting its GOR agreement. Three of the four major conferences now have such agreements, with the SEC the only exception.\n\n### Tier 3 events\n\nThe Big 12 is the only major conference that allows members to monetize TV rights for tier 3 events in football and men's basketball. This allows individual Big 12 member institutions to create tier 3 deals that include TV rights for one home football game and four home men's basketball games per season. Tier 3 rights exist for other sports as well, but these are not unique to the Big 12\\. The unique arrangement potentially allows Big 12 members to remain some of college sports' highest revenue earners. Other conferences' cable deals are subject to value reductions based on how people acquire cable programming; Big 12 universities' tier 3 deals are exempt. Texas alone earned more than $150 million of that total from their Longhorn Network before it was shut down with its move to the SEC.\n\nAs of 2022, all of the Big 12's tier 3 rights are held by ESPN; it bought the tier 3 rights to most Big 12 teams (besides Oklahoma) in 2019, moving the events exclusively to ESPN\\+. The Oklahoma Sooners retained an agreement with Bally Sports Oklahoma (which distributed its football game via pay-per-view) until 2022, when it also sold its rights to ESPN\\+. Prior to its departure to the SEC, ESPN also ran a dedicated cable network for the Texas Longhorns known as Longhorn Network, as a joint venture between the university and Learfield.\n\n### Business partnerships and innovation\n\nThe Big 12 has a sponsorship rights partnership with Learfield IMG College. The Big 12 announced on September 9, 2022, that it appointed WME Sports and IMG Media, Endeavor companies, to facilitate its global content and commercial strategy. Commissioner Brett Yormark stated \"We have aligned with a best-in-class team to build a best-in-class business strategy for the Conference\". November 14, 2022 Big 12 formed a comprehensive business advisor board composed of over three dozen entrepreneurial icons and respective industry leaders. From the likes of Monte Lipman the Founder/CEO Republic Records, Steve Stoute Founder/CEO UnitedMasters \\& Translation, Mark Shapiro President of Endeavor, Gary Vaynerchuk\u2019s VaynerMedia, singer Garth Brooks, NBA legend Jason Kidd, Keith Sheldon President of Entertainment for Hard Rock Cafe International, and Ross Levinsohn Chairman and CEO - The Arena Group \\& Sports Illustrated.\n\nThe Big 12 partnered with creative agency Translation to help build a more contemporary audience and brand.\nSoon after Big 12 Conference made a deal with A Bathing Ape (BAPE) for Championship games. The Conference and BAPE worked together to create limited-edition clothing and a camouflaged Big 12 logo throughout the stadium, arena, and uniforms.\n\nThe Big 12 has 11 official corporate partners: Allstate, Children\u2019s Health, Dr Pepper, Gatorade, Grand Caliber, Old Trapper, On Location, Phillips 66, Sonic Hard Seltzer, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Tickets For Less. There are dozens of other companies engaged as sponsors of the conference.\n\nOn March 15, 2023, before the NFL Draft, the Big 12 announced the first of its kind across all college conferences, being a conference-wide Pro Day. Instead of schools hosting separate pro days for their football players, there will be only one conference-wide scouting event before the 2024 NFL draft. The event will be held at the Dallas Cowboys training complex, Ford Center at The Star. What essentially would be a conference version of the NFL combine, the Pro Day would be televised on NFL Network.\n\nIn March, the Big 12 Conference announced a partnership with the legendary Rucker Park for a community engagement event. In June the event was officially announced as \"Big 12 Hoops in the Park\", to host men's and women's summer exhibition games. Throughout the event, the Big 12 is also preparing a number of entertainment activities and community engagements. The activities include youth clinics, meet-and-greets, live music, and food.\n\nEarly June 2023, the \"Big 12 Mexico\" was announced, which will include men's and women's soccer, baseball, basketball, and football games and an international media rights strategy. The Big 12 Mexico will debut in December 2024 with men's and women's basketball games between Kansas and Houston at the Arena CDMX in Mexico City. The Big 12 will also consider hosting a football bowl game in Monterrey beginning in 2026\\. This would be the first-ever bowl game in Mexico.\n\nConference annual revenue distribution\n--------------------------------------\n\n| Year | Total distributed | Annual increase | Average per universitya |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | $53\\.6 million | \u2013 | $4\\.5 million |\n| 1998 | $58 million | 8\\.2% | $4\\.8 million |\n| 1999 | $64 million | 10\\.3% | $5\\.3 million |\n| 2000 | $72 million | 12\\.5% | $6\\.0 million |\n| 2001 | $78 million | 8\\.3% | $6\\.5 million |\n| 2002 | $83\\.5 million | 7\\.1% | $7\\.0 million |\n| 2003 | $89 million | 6\\.6% | $7\\.4 million |\n| 2004 | $101 million | 13\\.5% | $8\\.4 million |\n| 2005 | $105\\.6 million | 4\\.6% | $8\\.8 million |\n| 2006 | $103\\.1 million | \u22122\\.4% | $8\\.6 million |\n| 2007 | $106 million | 2\\.8% | $8\\.8 million |\n| 2008 | $113\\.5 million | 7\\.1% | $9\\.5 million |\n| 2009 | $130 million | 14\\.5% | $10\\.8 million |\n| 2010 | $139 million | 6\\.9% | $11\\.6 million |\n| 2011 | $145 million | 4\\.3% | $12\\.1 million |\n| 2012 | $187 million | 29\\.0% | $18\\.7 million |\n| 2013 | $198 million | 5\\.9% | $19\\.8 million |\n| 2014 | $212 million | 7\\.1% | $21\\.2 million |\n| 2015 | $252 million | 18\\.9% | $25\\.2 million |\n| 2016 | $304 million | 20\\.6% | $30\\.4 million |\n| 2017 | $348 million | 14\\.5% | $34\\.8 million |\n| 2018 | $364 million | 4\\.9% | $36\\.5 million |\n| 2019 | $388 million | 6\\.3% | $38\\.8 million |\n| 2020 | $377 million | -2\\.8% | $37\\.7 million |\n| 2021 | $345 million | -8\\.5% | $34\\.5 million |\n| 2022 | $426 million | 23\\.5% | $42\\.6 million |\n| 2023 | $470 million | 10\\.3% | $39\\.8 million\u2020$18\\.0 million\u2021 |\n| a Twelve Big 12 members received disbursements each year from 1997 to 2011; ten each year afterwards. Individual universities' disbursement varied annually according to bylaw rules and entrance or withdrawal agreements.\u2020legacy 10-member institutions. \u2021Four new coming institutions(UCF, BYU, UC \\& UH). | | | |\n\nConference revenue comes mostly from television contracts, bowl games, the NCAA, merchandise, licensing and conference-hosted sporting events. The Conference distributes revenue annually to member institutions. From 1996 to 2011, 57 percent of revenue was allotted equally; while 43 percent was based upon the number of football and men's basketball television appearances and other factors. In 2011, the distribution was 76 percent equal and 24 percent based on television appearances. Changing the arrangement requires a unanimous vote; as a Big 12 member, Nebraska and Texas A\\&M had withheld support for more equitable revenue distribution.\n\nWith this model, larger universities can receive more revenue because they appear more often on television. In 2006, for example, Texas received $10\\.2 million, 44% more than Baylor University's $7\\.1 million.\n\nBig 12 revenue was generally less than other BCS conferences; this was due in part to television contracts signed with Fox Sports Net (four years for $48 million) and ABC/ESPN (eight years for $480 million).\n\nIn 2011, the Big 12 announced a new 13-year media rights deal with Fox that would ensure that every Big 12 home football game is televised, as well as greatly increasing coverage of women's basketball, conference championships and other sports. The deal, valued at an estimated $1\\.1 billion, runs until 2025\\. In 2012, the conference announced a new agreement with Fox and ESPN, replacing the current ABC/ESPN deal, to immediately increase national media broadcasts of football and increase conference revenue; the new deal was estimated to be worth $2\\.6 billion through the 2025 expiration. The two deals pushed the conference per-university payout to approximately $20 million per year, while separating third-tier media rights into separate deals for each university; such contracts secured an additional $6 million to $20 million per university annually. The per-university payout under the deal is expected to reach $44 million, according to Commissioner Bob Bowlsby.\n\nIn 2022, the conference renewed its media rights with ESPN and Fox Sports for six seasons starting in 2025\u201326, with an estimated US$380 million average annual fee.\n\nAthletic department revenue by school\n-------------------------------------\n\nTotal revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights and licensing, student fees, school funds and all other sources including TV income, camp income, concessions, and novelties.\n\nTotal expenses includes coach and staff salaries, scholarships, buildings and grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance.\n\nThe following table shows institutional reporting to the United States Department of Education as shown on the DOE Equity in Athletics website for the 2022\u201323 academic year.\n\n| Institution | 2022\u201323 Total Revenue from Athletics | 2022\u201323 Total Expenses on Athletics |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Texas Christian University | $149,297,918 | $149,297,918 |\n| University of Kansas | $205,747,275\\[a] | $139,748,616 |\n| University of Arizona | $138,761,638 | $136,866,623 |\n| Baylor University | $137,460,582 | $137,460,582 |\n| University of Colorado Boulder | $136,114,468 | $136,114,468 |\n| Arizona State University | $128,265,591 | $128,265,591 |\n| Texas Tech University | $123,551,688 | $113,108,592 |\n| Oklahoma State University | $119,235,776 | $118,229,024 |\n| University of Utah | $111,483,459 | $110,060,805 |\n| Brigham Young University | $106,430,702 | $106,430,702 |\n| West Virginia University | $103,142,400 | $103,142,400 |\n| Kansas State University | $102,332,761 | $96,925,648 |\n| Iowa State University | $93,048,114 | $92,987,544 |\n| University of Central Florida | $88,199,644 | $88,199,644 |\n| University of Houston | $84,023,065 | $84,023,065 |\n| University of Cincinnati | $77,436,016 | $77,436,016 |\n\n1. **^** This total may or may not include fundraising dollars to fund renovations at David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe following table shows Big 12 Conference distributions during the fiscal year ending June 2023 as reported by ProPublica using Schedule A of the Big 12 Conference tax filings\n\n| Institution | 2022\u201323 Distribution |\n| --- | --- |\n| Texas Christian University | $48,258,005 |\n| University of OklahomaLeft Big 12 for SEC July 1, 2024 | $45,195,567 |\n| Kansas State University | $45,038,935 |\n| University of TexasLeft Big 12 for SEC July 1, 2024 | $44,711,453 |\n| University of Kansas | $44,104,036 |\n| Oklahoma State University | $43,821,197 |\n| Texas Tech University | $43,663,496 |\n| Baylor University | $43,072,005 |\n| Iowa State University | $42,190,473 |\n| West Virginia University | $41,984,886 |\n| Average for 10 Schools | $44,204,005 |\n\nApparel\n-------\n\n| School | Provider |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arizona | Nike |\n| Arizona State | Adidas |\n| Baylor | Nike |\n| BYU | Nike |\n| Colorado | Nike |\n| Cincinnati | Nike, Air Jordan (basketball only) |\n| Houston | Nike, Air Jordan (basketball only) |\n| Iowa State | Nike |\n| Kansas | Adidas |\n| Kansas State | Nike |\n| Oklahoma State | Nike |\n| TCU | Nike |\n| Texas Tech | Adidas |\n| UCF | Nike |\n| Utah | Under Armour |\n| West Virginia | Nike |\n\nFacilities\n----------\n\n| School | Football stadium | Capacity | Basketball arena | Capacity | Baseball stadium | Capacity | Softball Stadium | Capacity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arizona | Arizona Stadium | 50,782 | McKale Center | 14,688 | Hi Corbett Field | 9,500 | Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium | 2,956 |\n| Arizona State | Mountain America Stadium | 53,599 | Desert Financial Arena | 14,198 | Phoenix Municipal Stadium | 8,775 | Alberta B.

However, in 2020 multiple National Championships were not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne former member of the conference did not win a National Championship while a member of the Big 12, Missouri. Original members Kansas State and Iowa State have not won a championship while representing the Big 12\\. The only national championships won by 2012 arrivals TCU and West Virginia since joining the Big 12 have been in rifle, a sport that the conference has never sponsored. Of the 2023 arrivals, Houston, UCF, and Cincinnati have not won a championship in the Big 12, but BYU has won in women\u2019s and men\u2019s cross country.\n\nMen's swimming has the most overall championships with 10, while men's golf has the most different schools win a championship with 4\\.\n\n| **Football (3\\):** 1997 \u2013 Nebraska 2000 \u2013 Oklahoma 2005 \u2013 Texas **Equestrian

results, with the teams with the best conference records from the North and South playing in the Big 12 Championship Game from 1996 to 2010\\. Baseball, basketball, softball, tennis and women's soccer titles are awarded in both regular-season and tournament play. Cross country, golf, gymnastics, swimming and diving, track and field, and wrestling titles are awarded during an annual meet of participating teams. The volleyball title is awarded based on regular-season play.\n\nAll-Time Big 12 Championships by University (through December 2, 2024\\)\n\n| University | Years | Regular Season | Postseason | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arizona Wildcats | 2024\u2013present | 0 | 0 | **0** |\n| Arizona State Sun Devils | 2024\u2013present | 0 | 2 | **2** |\n| Baylor Bears | 1996\u2013present | 48 | 41 | **89** |\n| BYU Cougars | 2023\u2013present | 0 | 3 | **3** |\n| Cincinnati Bearcats | 2023\u2013present | 0 | 0 | **0** |\n| Colorado Buffaloes | 1996\u20132011,2024\u2013present | *5* | *26* | ***31*** |\n| Houston Cougars | 2023\u2013present | 1 | 0 | **1** |\n| Iowa State Cyclones | 1996\u2013present | 4 | 27 | **31** |\n| Kansas Jayhawks | 1996\u2013present | 25 | 20 | **45** |\n| Kansas State Wildcats | 1996\u2013present | 11 | 7 | **18** |\n| Oklahoma State Cowboys | 1996\u2013present | 15 | 84 | **99** |\n| TCU Horned Frogs | 2012\u2013present | 12 | 8 | **21** |\n| Texas Tech Red Raiders | 1996\u2013present | 14 | 17 | **31** |\n| UCF Knights | 2023\u2013present | 0 | 0 | **0** |\n| Utah Utes | 2024\u2013present | 0 | 0 | **0** |\n| West Virginia Mountaineers | 2012\u2013present | 7 | 6 | **13** |\n\nFootball\n--------\n\nThe first football game in conference play was Texas Tech vs. Kansas State in 1996, won by Kansas State, 21\u201314\\.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2010, Big 12 Conference teams played eight conference games a season. Each team faced all five opponents within its own division and three teams from the opposite division. Inter-divisional play was a \"three-on, three-off\" system, where teams would play three teams from the other division on a home-and-home basis for two seasons, and then play the other three foes from the opposite side for a two-year home-and-home.\n\nThis format came under considerable criticism, especially from Nebraska and Oklahoma, who were denied a yearly match between two of college football's most storied programs.\\[*citation needed*] The Nebraska-Oklahoma rivalry was one of the most intense in college football history.\\[*citation needed*] (Until 2006, the teams had never met in the Big 12 Championship.) Due to the departure of Nebraska and Colorado in 2011, the Big 12 eliminated the divisions (and championship game) and instituted a nine-game round-robin format.\\[*citation needed*] With the advent of the College Football Playoff committee looking at teams' strength of schedule for picking the four playoff teams, on December 8, 2015, the Big 12 announced an annual requirement for all Big 12 teams to schedule a non-conference game against a team from the four other Power Five conferences (plus Notre Dame). Per Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby: \"Schedule strength is a key component in CFP Selection Committee deliberations. This move will strengthen the resumes for all Big 12 teams. Coupled with the nine-game full round robin Conference schedule our teams play, it will not only benefit the teams at the top of our standings each season, but will impact the overall strength of the Conference.\" The Big 12 has made it to the Playoffs 6 times from 2014 to 2023\\. Three Big 12 participants have made it to the playoff: Oklahoma in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019; Texas in 2023; and TCU in 2022\\.\n\n### Championship game\n\nThe Big 12 Championship Game game was approved by all members except Nebraska. It was held each year, commencing with the first match in the 1996 season at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis. It pitted the division champions against each other after the regular season was completed.\n\nFollowing the 2008 game, the event was moved to the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, being played there in 2009 and 2010\\. In 2010, the Sooners defeated the Cornhuskers 23\u201320\\.\n\nAfter 2010, the game was moved to Arlington for 2011, 2012, and 2013\\. However, the decision became moot following the 2010 season because the league lacked sufficient members.\n\nIn April 2015, the ACC and the Big 12 developed new rules for the NCAA to deregulate conference championship games. The measure passed on January 14, 2016, allowing a conference with fewer than 12 teams to stage a championship game that does not count against the FBS limit of 12 regular-season games under either of the following circumstances:\n\n* The game involves the top two teams following a full round-robin conference schedule.\n* The game involves two divisional winners, each having played a full round-robin schedule in its division.\n\nUnder the first criterion, the Big 12 championship game resumed at the conclusion of the 2017 regular season, and is played during the first weekend of December, the time all other FBS conference championship games are played.\n\n### Bowl affiliations\n\nThe following were bowl games for the Big 12 for the 2022 season.\\[*needs update*]\n\n| Pick | Name | Location | Opposing conference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u2013 | College Football Playoff | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| 1 | Sugar Bowl\u2020 | New Orleans, Louisiana | SEC |\n| 2 | Alamo Bowl | San Antonio, Texas | Pac-12 |\n| 3 | Cheez-It Bowl | Orlando, Florida | ACC |\n| 4 | Texas Bowl | Houston, Texas | SEC |\n| 5 | Liberty Bowl | Memphis, Tennessee | SEC |\n| 6 | Guaranteed Rate Bowl | Phoenix, Arizona | Big Ten |\n| 7\u2021 | Armed Forces Bowl | Fort Worth, Texas | AAC/C-USA |\n| 7\u2021 | First Responder Bowl | Dallas, Texas | AAC/ACC/C-USA |\n| \u2020The Big 12 champion will go to the Sugar Bowl unless selected for the College Football Playoff. In the event that the conference champion is selected for the playoff, the conference runner-up will go to the Sugar Bowl. In years in which the Sugar Bowl is a CFP semifinal, the Big 12 champion (runner-up if the champion is selected for the CFP) is slotted to the Cotton, Fiesta or Peach Bowls. \u2021The seventh selection is a \"flex pick.\" | | | |\n\n\u2021The seventh selection is a \"flex pick.\"\n\nRivalries\n---------\n\nThe Big 12 is known for rivalries (primarily in football) that mostly predate the conference. The Kansas-Missouri rivalry was the longest running, the longest west of the Mississippi, and the second longest in college football, dating back to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association before evolving into the Big Eight. It was played 119 times before Missouri left the Big 12\\. As of October 2012, the University of Kansas' athletic department had not accepted Missouri's invitations to play inter-conference rivalry games, putting the rivalry on hold. Sports clubs sponsored by the two universities continued to play each other. Kansas and Missouri renewed the rivalry in men's basketball starting in December 2021, and have announced that they will meet again in football in 2025\\.\n\nThe rivalry between TCU and Baylor, known as the Revivalry is also one of the longest running in college football, with the two universities having played each other \u2014 largely as Southwest Conference members \u2014 120 times since 1899\\. Following the 2024 game, TCU leads the series 59\u201354\u20137\\.\n\nSome of the football rivalries between Big 12 universities include:\n\n| Rivalry | Name | Trophy | Gamesplayed\u2020 | Began | Record |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arizona\u2013Arizona State | Duel in the Desert | Territorial Cup | 98 | 1899 | Arizona 51\u201345\u20131 |\n| Baylor\u2013Houston |  |  | 30 | 1950 | Baylor 15\u201314\u20131 |\n| Baylor\u2013TCU | The Bluebonnet Battle |  | 120 | 1899 | TCU 59\u201354\u20137 |\n| Baylor\u2013Texas Tech | Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Shootout |  | 83 | 1929 | Baylor 42\u201340\u20131 |\n| BYU\u2013Utah | Holy War | Beehive Boot | 102 | 1896 | Utah 62\u201336\u20134 |\n| Cincinnati\u2013UCF |  |  | 10 | 2015 | Tied 5\u20135 |\n| Cincinnati\u2013West Virginia |  |  | 22 | 1921 | West Virginia 18\u20133\u20131 |\n| Colorado\u2013Utah | Rumble in the Rockies |  | 70 | 1903 | Utah 35\u201332\u20133 |\n| Colorado\u2013Kansas State |  |  | 67 | 1912 | Colorado 45\u201321\u20131 |\n| Houston\u2013Texas Tech |  |  | 35 | 1951 | Houston 18\u201316\u20131 |\n| Iowa State\u2013Kansas State | Farmageddon |  | 108 | 1917 | Iowa State 54\u201350\u20134 |\n| Kansas\u2013Kansas State | Sunflower Showdown | Governor's Cup | 122 | 1902 | Kansas 65\u201352\u20135 |\n| TCU\u2013Texas Tech | The West Texas Championship | The Saddle Trophy | 67 | 1926 | Texas Tech 33\u201331\u20133 |\n\nMen's Basketball\n----------------\n\nAs of the end of the 2023-2024 season, nine current Big 12 members are among the teams with the most wins and/or the highest win percentage in NCAA Division 1 men's basketball: Kansas (\\#2 in wins, \\#3 in percentage), Cincinnati (\\#12 wins, \\#19 percentage), Utah (\\#15 wins, \\#22 percentage), BYU (\\#17 wins, \\#31 percentage), Arizona (\\#19 wins, \\#10 percentage), West Virginia (\\#20 wins, \\#36 percentage), Houston (\\#37 percentage), Oklahoma State (\\#39 wins), and Kansas State (\\#42 wins). On the list of the most Final Four appearances, Kansas is \\#5 and Cincinnati, Houston, and Oklahoma State are all tied (with several other schools) at \\#11\\.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2011, standings in conference play were not split among divisions, although the schedule was structured as if they were. Teams played a home-and-home against teams within their divisions and a single game against teams from the opposite division for a total of 16 conference games. After Nebraska and Colorado left, Big 12 play transitioned to an 18-game, double round robin schedule. When the conference temporarily expanded to 14 members for the 2023\u201324 season, the 18-game schedule remained, but the double round-robin was discontinued in favor of a new scheduling formula.\n\nStarting in 2024\u201325, the Big 12 will go to a 20-game schedule. Each team will face five opponents at home, five opponents on the road, and five opponents both home and away.\n\n### Conference champions\n\n|  | This section **does not cite any sources**.

FS1\\). Since 2012, ESPN has sublicensed college basketball games to CBS Sports. Beginning in 2025, ESPN will sublicense college football and basketball games to TNT Sports.\n\n### 2012 media deal\n\nOn September 7, 2012, the Big 12 announced a 13-year agreement with ESPN and Fox valued at $2\\.6 billion in total. ESPN and Fox split college football rights, while the basketball inventory was held by ESPN with sublicensing options for CBS Sports and Fox Sports. The agreement also included a grant of rights for all current Big 12 teams over the period of the contract.\n\nIn addition to the national agreement, each Big 12 university maintained the right to sell its \"third-tier\" covering selected events per-season (including one football game, basketball games, and other events outside of those sports). The third-tier rights to the Texas Longhorns are held through a channel dedicated to the team \u2014 Longhorn Network \u2014 which is operated by ESPN. In 2019, ESPN announced that it would acquire the third-tier rights to all Big 12 teams through 2024\u201325 (excluding Oklahoma and Texas, which are still under long-term contracts with ESPN\\+ and Longhorn Network respectively), and place their content on its subscription streaming service ESPN\\+. ESPN also acquired exclusive rights to all future Big 12 football championship games, replacing the previous alternation between ESPN and Fox.\n\n### 2025 extension deal\n\nOn October 30, 2022, the Big 12 announced that it had reached early broadcast deal to renew rights with ESPN network (includes ABC rights) and Fox. It is a six-year media rights agreement worth a total of $2\\.3 billion, but also reportedly includes an \"escalator clause\" that will raise the value of the contracts if only Power Five schools are added. By striking a deal prior to the exclusive negotiating window with ESPN and Fox, the Big 12 managed to achieve several of its primary objectives of stability and security, including the ability to consult its member schools to seek an extended grant of rights and potential future conference expansion. Fox's deal also places a slate of Big 12 college basketball games on Fox Sports for the first time.\n\n* **ESPN**:\n\t+ Football games will primarily air in a primetime window on ESPN\n\t+ Rights to the football Big 12 Championship Game\n\t+ Rights to the Big 12 basketball championship\n\t+ Rights to a slate of college basketball games\n\t+ Primary streaming partner under the branding Big 12 Now on ESPN\\+\n* **Fox Sports**:\n\t+ 26 football games per season:\n\t+ Rights to a slate of college basketball games\n* **TNT Sports**\n\t+ College football, men's basketball, and women's basketball games that would normally be broadcast on ESPN's streaming service ESPN\\+ will be licensed to TNT Sports to be broadcast on TNT and/or TBS, as well as the Max streaming service.\n* **CBS**\n\t+ Sublicense rights to select college basketball games\n* **NFL Network**:\n\t+ Will air conference wide Pro Day on NFL Network\n\n* Football games will primarily air in a primetime window on ESPN\n* Rights to the football Big 12 Championship Game\n* Rights to the Big 12 basketball championship\n* Rights to a slate of college basketball games\n* Primary streaming partner under the branding Big 12 Now on ESPN\\+\n\n* 26 football games per season:\n* Rights to a slate of college basketball games\n\n* College football, men's basketball, and women's basketball games that would normally be broadcast on ESPN's streaming service ESPN\\+ will be licensed to TNT Sports to be broadcast on TNT and/or TBS, as well as the Max streaming service.\n\n* Sublicense rights to select college basketball games\n\n* Will air conference wide Pro Day on NFL Network", "chunks": [{"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Big_12_Conference_0", "original_index": 0, "content": "Big 12 Conference\n|  | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Association | NCAA |\n| Founded | February 25, 1994 (1994-02-25) |\n| Commissioner | Brett Yormark (since 2022\\) |\n| Sports fielded | * 25 \t+ men's: 10 \t+ women's: 15 |\n| Division | Division I |\n| Subdivision | FBS |\n| No. of teams | 16 |\n| Headquarters | Irving, Texas |\n| Region | * South \t+ South Atlantic \t+ West South Central * Midwest \t+ East North Central \t+ West North Central * West \t+ Mountain \t+ Southwest |\n| Official website | big12sports.com |\n| Locations | |\n|  | |\n\n* 25\n\t+ men's: 10\n\t+ women's: 15\n\n* men's: 10\n* women's: 15\n\n* South\n\t+ South Atlantic\n\t+ West South Central\n* Midwest\n\t+ East North Central\n\t+ West North Central\n* West\n\t+ Mountain\n\t+ Southwest\n\n* South Atlantic\n* West South Central\n\n* East North Central\n* West North Central\n\n* Mountain\n* Southwest", "contextualized_text": ""}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Big_12_Conference_1", "original_index": 1, "content": "* East North Central\n* West North Central\n\n* Mountain\n* Southwest\n\nThe **Big 12 Conference** is a college athletic conference headquartered in Irving, Texas.
