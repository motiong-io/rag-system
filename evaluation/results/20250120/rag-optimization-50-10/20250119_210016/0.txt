Who is the 15th first lady of the United States?:
Harriet Lane Johnston, the niece of President James Buchanan, served as the acting First Lady of the United States during his presidency, from 1857 to 1861.

Generated answer: To determine your future wife's name, we need to gather the required information from the observations.

The 15th first lady of the United States is Harriet Lane Johnston, and her mother's name is Jane Ann Buchanan Lane. So, the first name we are looking for is "Jane".

The second assassinated president of the United States is Abraham Lincoln. However, the observations do not explicitly mention his mother's maiden name. But based on historical knowledge, Abraham Lincoln's mother's name was Nancy Hanks Lincoln, and her maiden name was "Hanks".

Therefore, if your future wife has the same first name as the 15th first lady's mother (Jane) and her surname is the same as the second assassinated president's mother's maiden name (Hanks), then your future wife's name would be Jane Hanks.
