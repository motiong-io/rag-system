        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
According to the text, during the years 1945 to 1947, Chelsea FC used a numbering system where the players wore numbered shirts, but the specific numbering system used is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that Thomas Lawton, who played for Chelsea during this period, scored a club-record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946-47 season, but the numbering system used during this time is not specified.

In another context, it is mentioned that in the 1933 FA Cup Final and in a 1928 match, a traditional numbering system was used, where:

1. Goalkeeper
2. Right full back (right side centre back)
3. Left full back (left side centre back)
4. Right half back (right side defensive midfield)
5. Centre half back (centre defensive midfield)
6. Left half back (left side defensive midfield)
7. Outside right (right winger)
8. Inside right (attacking midfield)
9. Centre forward
10. Inside left (attacking midfield)
11. Outside left (left winger)

However, without more specific information, it is unclear if this system was still in use during Lawton's time at Chelsea from 1945 to 1947.

What position or role did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC.


        


Generated answer: Based on the traditional numbering system mentioned, where the centre forward wears the number 9, it is likely that Tommy Lawton, playing as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC, would have worn the number 9 jersey. However, please note that this is an inference based on the traditional numbering system, and there is no explicit confirmation that this system was still in use during Lawton's time at Chelsea from 1945 to 1947.
