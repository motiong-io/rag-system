How many times had the Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship as of 2010?:
As of 2010, the Chicago Bulls had won the NBA Championship 6 times: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998.


        


Generated answer: To solve this, we need to know the number of times Brazil won the World Cup, the number of times the Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship, and the number of times the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl as of 2010.

We know that Brazil won the World Cup 5 times and the Chicago Bulls won the NBA Championship 6 times as of 2010. However, we don't have information about the Dallas Cowboys' Super Bowl wins in our initial data.

Assuming we can find that information, as of 2010, the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl 5 times (1971, 1977, 1992, 1993, and 1995).

Now, let's calculate: 
Brazil's World Cup wins + Chicago Bulls' NBA Championship wins = 5 + 6 = 11
 Multiply this by the Dallas Cowboys' Super Bowl wins: 11 * 5 = 55

So, as of 2010, you would be left with 55.

Check result: Y
