        Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart?:
Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any information about an Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. The contexts provided are about Janet Cumbrae Stewart's biography, and there is no mention of another Australian artist born in the same year (1883). If you have more information or context, I'd be happy to try and help you further.

Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart and a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors?:
Clarice Beckett (1887–1935) was not born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. 

The text does not explicitly state which Australian artist was born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. However, based on the list of notable members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors provided, none of the artists listed were born in 1883, the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart and a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors?:
Clarice Beckett (1887–1935) is not the answer since she was born 4 years after Janet Cumbrae Stewart. 

The answer is Cristina Asquith Baker, painter, print-maker (1868–1960) is not correct either since she was born 15 years before Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

The correct answer is not explicitly stated in the given text. However, based on the information provided in the text, we can see that there are several members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors who were born around the same time as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883). 

One of them is Amalie Sara Colquhoun (1894–1974), who was born 11 years after Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

Another one is Clarice Beckett (1887–1935), who was born 4 years after Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

And there is also Alice Marian Ellen Bale (1875–1955), who was born 8 years before Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

But none of these are born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

However, I can try to help you narrow down the possibilities. Since the artist is a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and was born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883), we can look for artists who match this criteria.
