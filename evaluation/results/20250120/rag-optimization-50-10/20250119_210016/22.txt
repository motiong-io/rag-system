Generated answer: To find the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census, we need to look at the populations of Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman, and Broken Arrow according to the 1990 United States census.

1. Oklahoma City: 444,719
2. Tulsa: 367,302
3. Norman: 80,071
4. Broken Arrow: 58,043

Now, let's add up these populations:
444,719 + 367,302 = 812,021
812,021 + 80,071 = 892,092
892,092 + 58,043 = 950,135
