        What is the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023?:
According to the provided context, the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is 'BA' which is Boeing.

What is the number of employees of Boeing as of 2023?:
According to the text, as of March 2024, The Boeing Company has 3,740 employees in Oklahoma City, but the text does not provide information about the total number of employees of Boeing worldwide as of 2023.

What is the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023?:
Based on the provided context, the companies listed are not exhaustive, but rather a portion of the S&P 500 companies. However, within the given text, we can find the alphabetical order of the companies by their ticker symbols.

The last company in the provided context is 'PPG' and the one before it is 'PPL' and then 'POOL', and 'PNW', and 'PSX', 'PM', 'PCG'. So the companies in reverse alphabetical order are PPG, PPL, POOL, PNW, PSX, PM, PCG.

However, to answer the question correctly, we need to find the second to last company in the entire S&P 500 list as of 2023. As the provided context only includes a portion of companies in the S&P 500 list and only up to companies with ticker symbol 'P' or 'B' and some other letters and not a full list of S&P 500 companies as of 2023.

To answer the question correctly, I would need access to a full list of S&P 500 companies as of 2023. Given the information available up to my cut-off date (01 March 2023), I was unable to find this information.

What is the number of employees of the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023?:
The S&P 500 is a stock market index that contains 500 of the largest companies in the US, and it is difficult to determine the second to last company alphabetically by ticker symbol without knowing all the companies. However, I can tell you that the second to last company alphabetically by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is "Zions Bancorporation" with ticker symbol "ZION". The last company alphabetically is likely "Zillow" or "Zscaler" but "Zillow" was removed from the S&P 500 in 2022.

Assuming that the information is available for "ZYNE" (Zynerba Pharmaceuticals) as the last and "ZION" (Zions Bancorporation) as the second to last company in the S&P 500 as of 2023, then the number of employees for ZYNE is not available in the text provided. But, I can tell that as of the provided text, another company is  "Agilent Technologies, Inc." which has 17,900 employees as of 2024.

However, considering the companies in ascending order by ticker symbol: ... , XOM, XRAY, YUM, YUMC, ZBRA, ZION, ZI, ZNGA, ZS, ZSC, ZYNE. Hence, "ZYNE" is the last and "ZSC" or "ZS" (Zscaler) is the second to last company. 

The number of employees of "ZS" (Zscaler) as of 2023 or 2024 is not available in the given text. Therefore I will consider Agilent Technologies as a reference point to get some similar kind of information from the given context and tell that Agilent Technologies has around 17,900 employees as of 2024.

Please note that the question might have been trying to refer to some company based on an assumption about S&P 500 companies' order by their ticker symbol which may not be accurate. Always verify such information from authentic sources like Wikipedia or official company websites for more accurate information on employee counts.

What is the number of employees of Boeing as of 2023?:
According to the context, The Boeing Company has 3,740 employees, but it is mentioned as of March 2024, not 2023. There is no information available in the given context about the number of employees as of 2023.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to know the number of employees of both the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 and the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023.

The company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is 'BA' which is Boeing. However, the number of employees of Boeing as of 2023 is not available in the given context. It is mentioned that as of March 2024, The Boeing Company has 3,740 employees in Oklahoma City, but the total number of employees worldwide is not provided.

The company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is likely "ZS" (Zscaler). However, the number of employees of "ZS" (Zscaler) as of 2023 or 2024 is not available in the given text.

Since we do not have the exact number of employees for both companies as of 2023, we cannot accurately calculate the difference in the number of employees between the two companies.

However, if we consider Agilent Technologies as a reference point (which has around 17,900 employees as of 2024), and assuming Boeing has around 140,000 to 150,000 employees (based on general knowledge, not provided in the context), and Zscaler has around 3,000 to 5,000 employees (based on general knowledge, not provided in the context), then we can estimate that Boeing might have around 135,000 to 147,000 more employees than Zscaler. 

Please note that this is a rough estimate and not based on the exact numbers provided in the context. Always verify such information from authentic sources like Wikipedia or official company websites for more accurate information on employee counts.
