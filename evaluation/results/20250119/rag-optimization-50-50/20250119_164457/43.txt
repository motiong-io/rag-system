        What is the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023?:
According to the provided text, the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is ADP (Automatic Data Processing).

How many employees does ADP (Automatic Data Processing) have as of 2023?:
According to the provided context, as of 2023, ADP (Automatic Data Processing) has 9,750 employees is not correct. The correct information is that Zebra Technologies Corporation has 9,750 employees in 2023.

The number of employees for ADP is not explicitly stated in the given contexts. However, it can be found in one of the contexts that Jersey City is home to companies such as Computershare, ADP, IPC Systems, and Fidelity Investments. But there's no information about how many people they employ.

One context mentions major corporations with over 1,000 employees in Oklahoma City but does not include ADP.

Another context lists S&P 500 component stocks and includes a section with companies from ADP to BALL but does not provide employee numbers for these companies specifically. 

Therefore I cannot give you an answer based on this data set.

Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to find out the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 and the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023.

The company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is ADP (Automatic Data Processing).

However, I do not have information about which company is alphabetically second to last. 

Additionally, I have conflicting information regarding ADP's employee count. Initially, it was stated that this information could not be found based on the provided data set. Later, it was mentioned that ADP has around 58,000 employees but then also stated they had around 9,750 employees which seems incorrect given other statements about large companies with over a thousand employees.

Given these discrepancies and lack of specific data on both required points (the second-to-last company and accurate employee numbers for ADP), I cannot accurately calculate how many more employees ADP has compared to the second-to-last company by ticker symbol in the S&P500 as of 2023.

Check result: N
