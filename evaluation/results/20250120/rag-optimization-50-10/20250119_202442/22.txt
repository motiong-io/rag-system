Generated answer: To find the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census, as per the 1990 United States census, we need to sum the populations of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as they were the only two cities among the ones mentioned that had a population of over 100,000 in 2020 and also had significant populations in 1990. Norman and Broken Arrow did not have a population of at least 100,000 in 1990.

The population of Oklahoma City in 1990 was 444,719.
The population of Tulsa in 1990 was 367,302.

Total population = Oklahoma City population + Tulsa population
Total population = 444,719 + 367,302
Total population = 812,021

So, according to the 1990 United States census, the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census was 812,021.
