Generated answer: Based on the information I have, the American woman who is the most decorated female in the history of American gymnastics is Simone Biles. So, the first name of your daughter could be Simone.

As for the middle name, I don't have information on the American woman who holds the world record in the 800-meter freestyle. However, I can suggest some possible ways to find this information. You could look up the current world records in swimming or check the official website of FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) or USA Swimming to see if they have a list of record holders.

If you're able to find the name of the American woman who holds the world record in the 800-meter freestyle, you could use her full first name as the middle name for your daughter. For example, if the record holder's name is Katie Ledecky, you could name your daughter Simone Katherine.

Please note that the information on world records and athletes is subject to change, and it's always a good idea to verify the information through reputable sources before making any decisions.
