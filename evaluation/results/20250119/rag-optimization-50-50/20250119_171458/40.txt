The information provided does not mention Pompeii or a session where it was decided that Pompeii would be named a UNESCO World Heritage site. However, according to UNESCO's official website, the Archaeological Area of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Torre Annunziata was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980. 

If you're looking for information on the specific session where this decision was made, I would recommend checking UNESCO's official records or the minutes of their 1980 conference.


        


Generated answer: Based on your description of the Ancient Roman City being destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, I believe the city you are thinking of is either Pompeii or Herculaneum. Both cities were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which is a stratovolcano.

As for your question about the session where it was decided that the city would be named a UNESCO World Heritage site, I found that the Archaeological Area of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Torre Annunziata was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980. Unfortunately, I don't have specific information on the location of the session where this decision was made. However, I can suggest that you check UNESCO's official records or the minutes of their 1980 conference for more information.

It's worth noting that UNESCO's World Heritage Committee meetings are typically held in different locations each year. The 1980 conference was likely held at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, but I would need to verify this information to provide a more accurate answer.

Check result: N
