        obersevations:
        What are the U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference?:
The U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference are:

1. Lincoln, Nebraska (University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln) 
2. Columbia, Missouri (University of Missouri)
3. Austin, Texas (University of Texas at Austin) 

These cities are the capitals of Nebraska, Missouri, and Texas, respectively.

Austin, Texas (University of Texas at Austin), since John F. Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson attended the University of Texas at Austin, and other mayors' university attendance is unknown or not matching any U.S. president.:
It appears you are looking for information about mayors and their connections to universities attended by U.S. presidents. 

The current mayor of Austin, Texas, is Kirk Watson. According to the provided information, Kirk Watson attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1980 and a Juris Doctor in 1981.

However, you are looking for connections between mayors and universities attended by U.S. presidents. In this case, there is a connection between Austin, Texas (the city where Kirk Watson is the mayor), and the University of Texas at Austin, which was attended by Lady Bird Johnson (the wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson) and not directly by any U.S. president, including John F. Kennedy, who attended Harvard University.

The connection is that Lady Bird Johnson attended the University of Texas at Austin, and Kirk Watson is the current mayor of Austin.

What is the first name of the mayor of Austin, Texas, as of August 2024?:
The first name of the mayor of Austin, Texas, as of August 2024, is Kirk.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to consider the U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference. These cities are Lincoln, Nebraska; Columbia, Missouri; and Austin, Texas.

We also need to find a connection between the mayor of one of these cities and a university attended by at least one U.S. president.

The information provided indicates that the University of Texas at Austin is attended by Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson, but not directly by any U.S. president, including John F. Kennedy, who attended Harvard University.

However, none of the mayors' university attendance matches any U.S. president, except for the fact that Kirk Watson, the mayor of Austin, Texas, attended Baylor University, but there's no direct connection to a U.S. president.

But since we are looking for a connection to a university attended by at least one U.S. president and Austin is home to the University of Texas at Austin which has a connection to Lady Bird Johnson and her husband President Lyndon B. Johnson and also John F Kennedy did not attend the University of Texas but his wife Jacqueline Kennedy's relatives did attend but more importantly  Lady Bird Johnson and her husband have a stronger connection to the city and Lyndon B Johnson attended Southwest Texas State University which is now known as Texas State University.

However since we do not have information about other mayors attending universities that have connections to U.S presidents we will go with Kirk Watson who is the mayor of Austin which has a university with connections to Lady Bird Johnson and her husband President Lyndon B Johnson.

So the first name of the mayor is Kirk.
