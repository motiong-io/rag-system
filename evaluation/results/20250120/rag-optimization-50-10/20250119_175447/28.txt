To calculate the answer, I need to follow the steps given:

1. Subtract 1963 from 2009: 2009 - 1963 = 46
2. Determine the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024. According to the information, there are 18 administrative regions (13 in metropolitan France and 5 overseas) in France, but I don't see any update for 2024. Assuming no changes, there are still 18 regions.
