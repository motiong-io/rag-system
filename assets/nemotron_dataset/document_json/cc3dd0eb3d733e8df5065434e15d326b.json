In the video, Khaled stated, \"Here's the thing, I make albums so people can play it. And you actually hear it. You know, driving your car you hear another car playing it. Go to the barber shop, you hear them playing it. You know, turn the radio on, and you hear them playing it. It's playing everywhere - it's called great music. It's called albums that you actually hear the songs. Not no mysterious shit, and you never hear it.\" Many people took the \"mysterious shit\" line to be about Tyler, who responded on Twitter when a follower told him, \"Wow doin pretty good for some mysterious shit.\" Tyler told the follower, \"yeah i am, IGOR OUT NOW.\"\n\nTrack listing\n-------------\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\\. | \"Holy Mountain\" (featuring Buju Banton, Sizzla, Mavado, and 070 Shake) | * Khaled Khaled * Mark Myrie * Miguel Collins * David Brooks * Danielle Balbuena * Brittany Coney * Denisia Andrews * Omar Walker * Henry Lawes * Billy Rowe | * DJ Khaled * Major Seven | 4:54 |\n| 2\\. | \"Wish Wish\" (featuring Cardi B and 21 Savage) | * Khaled * Belcalis Almanzar * Shayaa Abraham-Joseph * Jordan Thorpe * Brytavious Chambers | * DJ Khaled * Tay Keith | 3:22 |\n| 3\\. | \"Jealous\" (featuring Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, and Big Sean) | * Khaled * Christopher Brown * Dwayne Carter, Jr. * Sean Anderson * Coney * Andrews * Chambers * Kingsley Gardner * Diana King * Andrew Saidenberg * Roger Ball * Malcolm Duncan * Stephen Ferrone * Alan Gorrie * Owen McIntyre * James Stewart | * DJ Khaled * Tay Keith * Nova Wav\\[b] | 4:15 |\n| 4\\. | \"Just Us\" (featuring SZA) | * Khaled * Sol\u00e1na Rowe * Coney * Andrews * Andr\u00e9 Benjamin * Antwan Patton * David Sheats | * DJ Khaled * LVM\\[b] | 3:41 |\n| 5\\. | \"You Stay\" (featuring Meek Mill, J Balvin, Lil Baby, and Jeremih) | * Khaled * Robert Williams * Jose Balvin * Dominique Jones * Jeremy Felton * Coney * Andrews * Ralph Middlebrooks * Clarence Satchell * William Beck * Leroy Bonner * Marshall Jones * Marvin Pierce * James Williams * Sergio George * Linda Caballero * Shirley Marte | * DJ Khaled * Ben Billions\\[b] * Rashad Smith\\[b] | 4:35 |\n| 6\\. | \"Celebrate\" (featuring Travis Scott and Post Malone) | * Khaled * Jacques Webster II * Austin Post * Travis Walton * Adam Feeney | * DJ Khaled * Teddy Walton * Frank Dukes * Louis Bell\\[c] * Aaron Bow\\[c] | 3:26 |\n| 7\\. | \"Higher\" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend) | * Khaled * Ermias Asghedom * John Stephens * Kevin Cossom * HM Henry Davis | * DJ Khaled * Streetrunner * Tarik Azzouz | 2:56 |\n| 8\\. | \"Won't Take My Soul\" (featuring Nas and CeeLo Green) | * Khaled * Nasir Jones * Thomas Callaway * Cossom * Azzouz * Roberto Curti * Warwar * Leah Marie * Nathaniel Levingston | * DJ Khaled * Streetrunner * Azzouz * Swede\\[b] | 4:19 |\n| 9\\. | \"Weather the Storm\" (featuring Meek Mill and Lil Baby) | * Khaled * Williams * Jones * Warwar * Azzouz * Alec Costandinos * Michel Jouveaux | * DJ Khaled * Streetrunner * Azzouz | 2:33 |\n| 10\\. | \"Big Boy Talk\" (featuring Jeezy and Rick Ross) | * Khaled * Jay Jenkins * William Roberts * Andre Lyon * Marcello Valenzano * Rayshon Cobbs, Jr. * Pete Jackson | * DJ Khaled * Cool \\& Dre * 808-Ray | 2:45 |\n| 11\\. | \"Freak n You\" (featuring Lil Wayne and Gunna) | * Khaled * D.
