Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to combine the information from the given observations. 

The U.S. president who won Alaska is Lyndon B. Johnson. 
The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald R. Ford.

Since these are two different presidents, we need to find the common ground between them, which in this case is not applicable as they are different individuals.

However, to answer your question directly: 
The middle name of Lyndon B. Johnson is Baines.
The middle name of Gerald R. Ford is Rudolph.

So, there isn't a single U.S. president who won Alaska, graduated from Yale University, and had a son named Michael, but rather two separate presidents with these characteristics: Lyndon B. Johnson (won Alaska, middle name Baines) and Gerald R. Ford (graduated from Yale University, had a son named Michael, middle name Rudolph).
