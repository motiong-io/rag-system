The car was again powered by the Ford HBD V8 engine.\n\nMinardi team drivers during 1994 were Pierluigi Martini and former Grand Prix winner Michele Alboreto. The team's test driver was Luca Badoer.\n\nThe M194 would only score two points during its 11 races, both when Martini finished in 5th place at the car's second race, the French Grand Prix. The team in fact scored more points in 1994 (3 points) using the M193B than with the M194\\. The combined 5 point total saw Minardi only finish tenth in the Constructors' Championship.\n\nThe M194 was replaced for the 1995 season by the Minardi M195\\.
