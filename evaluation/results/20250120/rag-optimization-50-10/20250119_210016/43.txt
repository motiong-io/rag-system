Generated answer: To answer this question, I need to break it down into smaller parts.

First, I need to find the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023. According to my knowledge, the company is Aon (AON), a financial company that provides insurance brokerage services.

Next, I need to find the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023. Unfortunately, I don't have this information in my knowledge.

Lastly, I need to find the number of employees for both companies. For Aon (AON), I don't have the exact number of employees as of 2023. For the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol, I also don't have this information.
