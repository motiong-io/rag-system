However, in another context, it is mentioned that "According to Arlington's 2023 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), the top five employers... include:" but ADP is not among them. Then it says "Approximately 43% of Arlington renters and 28% of homeowners were paying 35% or more of their household income for housing costs in 2011.\n\nEconomy\n-------\n\n### Top employers\n\n| ADP | Automatic Data Processing | Industrials | Human Resource & Employment Services | Roseland, New Jersey | 1981-03-31 | 0000008670 | 1949 |\n| AZO | AutoZone | Consumer Discretionary | Automotive Retail | Memphis, Tennessee | 1997-01-02 | 0000866787 | 1979 |\n|...".

Then in another context: "As of March 2024, the top 20 employers in the city were:\n\n| # | Employer | # of employees |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | State of Oklahoma (State Capital) | 37,600 |\n| 2 | Tinker Air Force Base | 26,000 |\n| 3 | Oklahoma State University-Stillwater | 13,940 |\n| 4 | University of Oklahoma-Norman | 11,530 |\n| 5 | Integris Health | 11,000 |\n| 6 | Amazon | 8,000 |\n| 7 | Hobby Lobby Stores (HQ) | 6,500 |\n| 8 | Mercy Health Center (HQ) | 6,500 |\n| 9 | SSM Health Care (Regional HQ) | 5,600 |\n| 10 | FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center | 5,150 |\n| 11 | University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center | 5000 |\n| 12 | City of Oklahoma City | 4,500 |\n| 13 | OU Medical Center | 4,360 |\n| 14 | Paycom (HQ) | 4,200 |\n| 15 | The Boeing Company | 3,740 |\n| 16 | Midfirst Bank (HQ) | 3,100 |\n| 17 | Norman Regional Hospital | 2,740 |\n| 18 | AT&T | 2,700 |\n| 19 | OGE Energy Corp (HQ) | 2,240 |\n| 20 | Dell | 2,100 |\n", ADP is not present.

Finally in another context: "Zebra Technologies Corporation\n|  | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Headquarters in Lincolnshire, Illinois | |\n| Company type | Public |\n| Traded as | * Nasdaq: ZBRA (Class A) * S&P 500 component |\n| Industry | Computer hardware, Manufacturing, Retail, Health care, Transportation and logistics |\n| Founded | 1969; 56 years ago (1969) |\n| Founders | * Ed Kaplan * Gerhard Cless |\n| Headquarters | Lincolnshire, Illinois, U.S. |\n| Key people | * Anders Gustafsson (chair) * William Burns (CEO) |\n| Products | RFID printers/encoders, barcode printers, mobile printers, card imaging printers, kiosk printers, real-time locating systems, UWB and related supplies and services, rugged mobile computers and tablets, scanners, software |\n| Revenue | Decrease US$4.58 billion (2023) |\n| Operating income | Decrease US$481 million (2023) |\n| Net income | Decrease US$296 million (2023) |\n| Total assets | Decrease US$7.31 billion (2023) |\n| Total equity | Increase US$3.04 billion (2023) |\n| Number of employees | **9,750 (2023)** |
