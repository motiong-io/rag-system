Generated answer: Based on the information available, I can suggest a possible name for your daughter. 

As we previously discussed, the American woman who is the most decorated female in the history of American gymnastics is Simone Biles. So, you could consider "Simone" as the first name for your daughter.

However, I couldn't find any information about an American woman who holds the world record in the 800-meter freestyle. If you could provide more context or clarify which American woman you are referring to, I might be able to help you with the middle name.

But if I had to suggest a name based on available information, I would propose "Simone" as the first name. For the middle name, I would need more information about the American woman who holds the world record in the 800-meter freestyle. 

If you provide more context or clarify the middle name, I can give you a complete suggested name for your daughter.
