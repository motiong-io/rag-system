He remained active on Broadway acting in the musicals *The Rink* in 1984, *Personals* in 1985, and the Neil Simon play *Broadway Bound* in 1986\\.

Greenspan, an accounting manager. Greenspan later borrowed his father's first name to create his stage name, Jason Alexander.\n\nAlexander grew up in Maplewood and Livingston, New Jersey, and is a 1977 graduate of Livingston High School. Interested in magic from an early age, he initially hoped to be a magician, but while attending a magic camp was told that his hands were too small for card magic. He became interested in theater, eventually realizing, \"Wait a minute\u2014the whole thing's an illusion. Nothing up there is real\" and that theater itself was \"a magic trick\". He then decided to pursue a theater career.\n\nAfter high school, he studied theater at Boston University. He wanted to pursue classical acting, but a professor redirected him toward comedy after noticing his physique, remarking, \"I know your heart and soul are Hamlet, but you will never play Hamlet.\" Alexander left Boston University without a degree after his third year to take a full-time acting job in New York City. The university awarded him an honorary degree in 1995\\.\n\nCareer\n------\n\n### 1980\u20131999: Broadway debut and *Seinfeld*\n\nAlexander began his acting career on the New York stage and is an accomplished singer and dancer. Alexander made his film debut in 1981 in the summer camp slasher film *The Burning*. On Broadway he appeared in Stephen Sondheim's *Merrily We Roll Along* in 1981, Kander \\& Ebb's *The Rink* in 1984, Neil Simon's *Broadway Bound* in 1986, *Accomplice* in 1990, and *Jerome Robbins' Broadway* in 1989, for which he garnered the 1989 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Frank Rich of *The New York Times* wrote of his performance \"Jason Alexander, the evening's delightful narrator, accomplishes the seemingly impossible: he banishes the memory of Zero Mostel from the role of Pseudolus in *A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum*\".\n\nIn addition to his roles as an insensitive, money-hungry lawyer in *Pretty Woman* in 1990, Alexander has appeared in *Jacob's Ladder* in 1990, *Coneheads* in 1993, *The Paper* and *North* in 1994, *The Last Supper* in 1995, *Dunston Checks In* in 1996, *Love! Valour! Compassion!* in 1997, *Denial* in 1998, and *Love and Action in Chicago* in 1999\\. Alexander starred in several commercials during the 1980s. Among them were commercials for Hershey's Kiss; Delta Gold potato chips; Miller Lite beer; McDonald's McDLT hamburger; Pabst Blue Ribbon beer; Levi's 501 jeans; Sony Watchman TV; and Western Union wire transfer. Before *Seinfeld*, Alexander appeared in commercials for John Deere and McDonald's and in the short-lived CBS sitcom *Everything's Relative* (1987\\).\n\nAlexander is best known as one of the key cast members of the award-winning television sitcom *Seinfeld*, where he played the bumbling George Costanza (Jerry Seinfeld's character's best friend since childhood). He was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards for the role, but did not win any, mainly due to his co-star Michael Richards winning for his role as Cosmo Kramer. He did, however, win the 1995 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nConcurrently with his *Seinfeld* role, he had a part in the ABC sitcom *Dinosaurs* as Al \"Sexual\" Harris (who frequently engaged in sexual harassment) as well as other characters from 1991 to 1994\\. For his role in an episode of *Dream On*, Alexander was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 1994\\. Alexander voiced the lead character in the animated series *Duckman* (1994\u20131997\\) and voiced Catbert, the evil director of human resources, in the short-lived animated series *Dilbert* from 1999 to 2000, based on the then-popular comic strip. In January 1995, he did a commercial for Rold Gold pretzels to be broadcast during the Super Bowl. The commercial depicts him with *Frasier* dog Eddie jumping out of an airplane with a parachute over the stadium. After the commercial, the audience is brought back to a supposedly live feed of the playing field hearing startled sports commentators as Alexander and the dog land in the field to wild applause.\n\nAlexander appeared in the 1995 TV version of the Broadway musical *Bye Bye Birdie*, as Conrad Birdie's agent, Albert Peterson. He guest-starred in episode 8 of the 1996 variety show *Muppets Tonight*. He voiced the gargoyle Hugo in Disney's 1996 animated film *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* and its direct-to-video sequel, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame II*. Alexander voiced the character Abis Mal in the 1994 film *The Return of Jafar* and the 1994-1995 TV series based on the 1992 film *Aladdin*.\n\nIn 1997, he appeared in *Cinderella*, a remake of *Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella,* alongside Whitney Houston, Brandy Norwood, and Whoopi Goldberg. His other Disney voice work includes *House of Mouse* in 2001 and the 2012 video game *Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance*. He has dabbled in directing, starting with 1996's *For Better or Worse* and 1999's *Just Looking*. In 1999, Alexander presided over the *New York Friars Club Roast* event honoring Jerry Stiller, who played his father on *Seinfeld*; it featured appearances by Kevin James and Patton Oswalt, both Stiller's costars on *The King of Queens*.

The year 2001 marked his appearance as inept womanizer Mauricio in *Shallow Hal* and his first post-*Seinfeld* return to prime-time television: the heavily promoted but short-lived ABC sitcom *Bob Patterson*, which was canceled after five episodes. Alexander partially blames the show's failure on the country's mood after 9/11\\. Alexander made cameo appearances as himself in 2001 in the second season of *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, and he appeared in the show's seventh season with his three principal *Seinfeld* co-stars. He was featured in the *Friends* 2001 episode \"The One Where Rosita Dies\" as Earl, a suicidal supply manager. Phoebe calls him trying to sell him toner, learns about his problem, and tries to persuade him not to commit suicide. This is referenced in an episode of *Malcolm in the Middle* where Alexander appears as Leonard, a neurotic and critical loner. He describes himself as \"free\" and says he makes money \"selling toner over the phone\". Later in the episode, he is repeatedly harassed by a man named George.\n\nHe appeared in \"One Night at Mercy\", the first episode of the short-lived 2002 revival of The Twilight Zone, playing Death. He played the toymaker A.C. Gilbert in the 2002 film *The Man Who Saved Christmas*. He appeared in Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) commercials in 2002, including one with Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants and another with Trista Rehn of *The Bachelorette*. It was rumored that he quit doing these commercials due to KFC suppliers and slaughterhouses' alleged cruelty to animals, but he denied that in an interview with *Adweek*, saying, \"That's PETA bullcrap. I loved working for KFC. I was targeted by PETA to broker something between them. I think KFC really stepped up to the plate; unfortunately PETA did not.\" In 2007, Alexander appeared in a commercial for the ASPCA that aired on cable TV stations. In 2018, Alexander portrayed Colonel Sanders in commercials for KFC, reprising his role from the 2002 campaign.\n\nIn 2003, he was cast opposite Martin Short in the Los Angeles production of Mel Brooks's *The Producers*. He appeared with Kelsey Grammer in the 2004 musical adaptation of Charles Dickens's *A Christmas Carol*, as Jacob Marley. Alexander's second chance as a TV series lead, the CBS sitcom *Listen Up* (2004\u201305\\), also fell short of a second season. Alexander was the principal executive producer of the series, based very loosely on the life of the popular sports-media personality Tony Kornheiser. He performed on the *Family Guy: Live in Vegas* 2005 album. Alexander continued to appear in live stage shows, including Barbra Streisand's memorable birthday party in 2005 for Stephen Sondheim at the Hollywood Bowl, where he performed selections from *Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street* with Angela Lansbury.

In 2007, Alexander was a guest star in the third episode of the improv comedy series *Thank God You're Here*.\n\nHe has been a frequent guest and panelist on Bill Maher's *Politically Incorrect* in 1995, 1997 and 2000 and *Real Time* in 2006, 2009 and 2012; *Hollywood Squares* in 1999, 2002 and 2004; the *Late Late Show* in 2003, 2012, 2014 and 2015, with Craig Kilborn, Craig Ferguson, and James Corden; *Late Show with David Letterman* in 1989, 2000, and 2002; *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* in 2015; and *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in 2015\\. In 2008, Alexander guest-starred in the season four episode \"Masterpiece\" of the CBS show *Criminal Minds* as Professor Rothschild, a well-educated serial killer obsessed with the Fibonacci sequence who sends the team into a race against time to save his last victims. He returned in the same season to direct the episode \"Conflicted\", featuring the actor Jackson Rathbone.\n\nAlexander hosted the LOL Sudbury opening night gala in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada in 2008, which was simulcast throughout Canada at 60 Cineplex theaters, a first for any comedy festival.

When asked about the IDF, Alexander stated that they were humane and noble, stating \"some of the finest, most humane, most admirable, most noble-serving soldiers that I've ever seen\" and that \"there can never be any doubt that I am also an advocate for Israel\". When asked about why he had repeatedly emceed the event, Alexander stated, \"They don\u2019t understand first of all what \\[FIDF] is, and they see it as just a blanket support for Israeli military, and they don\u2019t understand how I can say that I\u2019m an advocate for both sides. And given the fact that there are eyes on this event tonight, I thought it was important to get up and say, 'This is why I can advocate for this group and I can advocate for Israel, and I\u2019m not blind to the fact that we\u2019re in conflict, and I hold everyone equally accountable, and I hold everyone equally to my heart.'\" On November 6, 2015 he again emceed an event at The Beverly Hilton Hotel in California, which raised $31 million for the, \"provid\\[ing] educational, cultural and recreational programs and facilities for IDF soldiers.\"\n\nAlexander is a supporter of the Democratic Party.
