Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, we know that the 15th First Lady of the United States is Harriet Lane Johnston, and her mother's first name is Jane.

Next, we are given that the second president to be assassinated was Abraham Lincoln. However, to find his mother's maiden name, we need additional information not provided in the observations. 

After researching outside of the given observations (since this specific information isn't provided), I found that Abraham Lincoln's mother's maiden name was Nancy Hanks.

So, combining these pieces of information: 
- The first name is Jane (from Jane Ann Buchanan Lane).
- The surname is Hanks (from Nancy Hanks Lincoln).

Therefore, your future wife's name would be Jane Hanks.

Check result: N
