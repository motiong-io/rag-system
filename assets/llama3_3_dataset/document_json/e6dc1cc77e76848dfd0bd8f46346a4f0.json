Her list of accolades makes her one of the most award-winning actresses in American television history, and she has received more Primetime Emmy Awards and more Screen Actors Guild Awards than any other performer.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus was born in New York City, the daughter of the French billionaire G\u00e9rard Louis-Dreyfus, and entered comedy as a performer with the Practical Theatre Company in Chicago. This led to her being cast in the sketch show *Saturday Night Live*. Her breakthrough came in 1990 with her debut at the start of a nine-season run on *Seinfeld*, which became one of the most critically and commercially successful sitcoms. In addition to leading roles on *The New Adventures of Old Christine* and *Veep*, she has made guest appearances on shows such as *Arrested Development*, *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, and *30 Rock*. On film, Louis-Dreyfus has had supporting film roles in *Hannah and Her Sisters* (1986\\), *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation* (1989\\), *Deconstructing Harry* (1997\\), and *You People* (2023\\), and leading film roles in *Enough Said* (2013\\), *Downhill* (2020\\), *You Hurt My Feelings* (2023\\), and *Tuesday* (2023\\).

She has also received numerous honors including the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2018 and the National Medal of Arts in 2021\\.\n\nEarly life\n----------\n\nJulia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York City on January 13, 1961\\. Her mother, Judith (n\u00e9e LeFever), is an American writer and special needs educator. Her father, G\u00e9rard Louis-Dreyfus (1932\u20132016\\), was a French billionaire who served as chairman of the Louis Dreyfus Company. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus (1908\u20132011\\), was president of the Louis Dreyfus Group commodities and shipping conglomerate. He was a member of a Jewish family from Alsace, and served as a cavalry officer and member of the French Resistance during World War II. Louis-Dreyfus is the great-great-granddaughter of French businessman L\u00e9opold Louis-Dreyfus (1833\u20131915\\), founder of the Louis Dreyfus Group, which members of her family still control. She is the fifth cousin four times removed of Alfred Dreyfus (1859\u20131935\\) of the infamous Dreyfus affair. Robert Louis-Dreyfus (1946\u20132009\\), her father's second cousin, was the CEO of Adidas and owner of the soccer team Olympique de Marseille. Julia's paternal grandmother was the daughter of a Brazilian-Jewish father (whose family was Dutch, English, and Polish).\n\nIn 1962, a year after her birth, Louis-Dreyfus' parents divorced. She has said that she first noticed her penchant for comedy after sticking raisins up her nose at the age of three, which first made her mother laugh but then led to an emergency hospital visit. After moving to Washington, D.C., when Louis-Dreyfus was four, her mother married L. Thompson Bowles, dean of the George Washington University Medical School; Louis-Dreyfus gained a half-sister, Lauren Bowles, also an actress. Due to her stepfather's work with Project HOPE, she spent her childhood in several U.S. states and countries such as Colombia, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia. In 1979, she graduated from the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland. She later said of the school, \"There were things I did in school that, had there been boys in the classroom, I would have been less motivated to do. For instance, I was president of the honor society.\"\n\nLouis-Dreyfus attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she was a member of the Delta Gamma sorority. She studied theatre and performed in the Mee-Ow Show, a student-run improv and sketch comedy revue, before dropping out during her junior year to take a job at *Saturday Night Live*. In 2007, she received an honorary doctor of arts degree from Northwestern University.\n\nCareer\n------\n\n### 1982\u20131989: Early career and *Saturday Night Live*\n\nAs part of her comedic training, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in The Second City, one of the best-known improvisational theatre groups. It was her performance with The Practical Theatre Company at their \"Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee\" that led to her being asked to join the cast of NBC's *Saturday Night Live* at the age of 21\\.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus subsequently became a cast member on *Saturday Night Live* from 1982 to 1985, the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time. It was during her third and final year on *SNL* that she met writer Larry David during his only year on the show. David later co-created *Seinfeld*. Louis-Dreyfus has commented that her casting on *SNL* was a \"Cinderella-getting-to-go-to-the-ball kind of experience\"; however, she has also admitted that at times it was often quite tense, stating that she \"didn't know how to navigate the waters of show business in general and specifically doing a live sketch-comedy show\".\n\n**Recurring characters on *Saturday Night Live***\n\n* April May June, a televangelist\n* Becky, El Dorko's (Gary Kroeger) date\n* Consuela, Chi Chi's friend and co-host of *Let's Watch TV*\n* Darla in *SNL*'s parody of *The Little Rascals*\n* Weather Woman, a superhero who controls the weather\n* Patti Lynn Hunnsucker, a teenage correspondent on Weekend Update\n\nFollowing her 1985 departure from *SNL*, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in several films, including *Hannah and Her Sisters* (1986\\) by Woody Allen, *Soul Man* (1986\\), and *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation* (1989\\), in which she starred alongside fellow *SNL* alumnus Chevy Chase. In 1987, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in the NBC sitcom pilot *The Art of Being Nick*, an intended spin-off from *Family Ties* starring Scott Valentine. When the pilot did not make it to series, Louis-Dreyfus was retained by producer Gary David Goldberg for a role on his new sitcom *Day by Day*, as the sarcastic and materialistic neighbor, Eileen Swift. Premiering in early 1988, *Day by Day* aired for two seasons on NBC before being cancelled.\n\n### 1990\u20131998: *Seinfeld* and widespread recognition\n\nIn the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC's *Seinfeld*. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the pilot episode, \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric and demanded that creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who also eventually enjoyed TV success, including Patricia Heaton and Megan Mullally. On the \"Notes About Nothing\" featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus's ability to eat a peanut M\\&M without breaking the peanut described her: \"She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.\"\n\nLouis-Dreyfus garnered critical acclaim for her performance on the series, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998\\. In 1996, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998\\. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus said the win was a \"shocker\", and that after being in both positions, it was \"much better to win than to lose.\"\n\nIn 1998, Jerry Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The series finale aired on May 14 and was one of the most-watched TV events in history, with over 76 million viewers tuning in. During her time on *Seinfeld,* she appeared in several films, including the comedy films *Fathers' Day* (1997\\), opposite Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and Woody Allen's *Deconstructing Harry* (1997\\).\n\n### 1999\u20132004: Post-*Seinfeld*\n\nFollowing a voice role in the highly successful Pixar film *A Bug's Life* (1998\\), Louis-Dreyfus lent her voice as Snake's girlfriend Gloria in *The Simpsons* episode \"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\". In 2001, she made several special guest appearances on *Seinfeld* co-creator Larry David's show *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, playing herself fictionally trying to break the \"curse\" by planning to star in a show in which she would play an actress affected by a *Seinfeld*-like curse.\n\nAfter several years away from a regular TV job, Louis-Dreyfus began a new single-camera sitcom, *Watching Ellie*, which premiered on NBC in February 2002\\. The series was created by husband Brad Hall and co-starred Steve Carell and Louis-Dreyfus's half-sister Lauren Bowles. The initial premise of the show was to present viewers with a \"slice of life\" from the goings-on and happenings of the life of Ellie Riggs, a Southern California jazz singer. The first season included a 22-minute countdown kept digitally in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, which many critics panned, claiming it was useless and \"did nothing for the show.\" Overall, the show received mixed reviews but debuted strongly with over 16 million viewers tuning in for the series premiere, and maintained an average audience of about 10 million viewers per week.\n\nWhen the series returned for a second season in the spring of 2003, it suffered a decline in viewership, averaging around eight million viewers per week. The show had undergone a drastic stylistic change between the production of seasons one and two. The first season was filmed in the single-camera format, but the second season was presented as a traditional multicamera sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience. With dwindling viewership and failing to retain the numbers from its *Frasier* lead-in, the series was cancelled by NBC in May 2003\\.\n\nFollowing NBC's cancellation of *Watching Ellie*, the media began circulating rumors of a so-called \"Seinfeld curse\", which claimed that none of the former *Seinfeld* actors could ever achieve success again in the television industry. Louis-Dreyfus dismissed the rumor as \"a made-up thing by the media\", while *Seinfeld* co-creator Larry David asserted that the curse was \"completely idiotic.\" Louis-Dreyfus was interested in the role of Susan Mayer on *Desperate Housewives*, the role that ultimately went to Teri Hatcher. Instead, Louis-Dreyfus scored a recurring guest role as Maggie Lizer, the deceitful prosecutor and love interest of Michael Bluth on the Emmy-winning comedy *Arrested Development*, from 2004 to 2005\\.\n\n### 2005\u20132010: *The New Adventures of Old Christine*\n\nIn 2005, Louis-Dreyfus was cast in the title role of a new CBS sitcom, *The New Adventures of Old Christine*. The series and its concept were created by writer and producer of *Will \\& Grace*, Kari Lizer. The series told the story of Christine Campbell, a single mother who manages to maintain a fantastic relationship with her ex-husband while running a women's gym. The series debuted on CBS in March 2006 to an audience of 15 million and was initially a ratings winner for the network.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus received considerable critical acclaim for her performance on the show, with Brian Lowry of *Variety* stating that Louis-Dreyfus broke the so-called \"*Seinfeld* curse \\[...] with one of the best conventional half-hours to come along in a while.\" Alessandra Stanley from *The New York Times* asserted that Louis-Dreyfus's performance on the series proved she is \"one of the funniest women on network television.\" Louis-Dreyfus also earned the 2006 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in the first season. Referring to the curse, she stated in her acceptance speech, \"I'm not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!\" Throughout the course of the series, she received five consecutive Emmy Award nominations, three consecutive Satellite Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. In 2007, she also received two nominations for a People's Choice Award due to her return to popularity, thanks to the success of *Old Christine*.\n\nIn May 2006, Louis-Dreyfus hosted an episode of *Saturday Night Live*, becoming the first female former cast member to return to the show as a host. In the episode, she appeared with her *Seinfeld* co-stars Jason Alexander and Jerry Seinfeld in her opening monologue, parodying the so-called \"*Seinfeld* curse\". After a successful reception of her 2006 episode, Louis-Dreyfus again hosted *SNL* on March 17, 2007, and April 17, 2016\\. Louis-Dreyfus reprised her role as Gloria in two *Simpsons* episodes: 2007's \"I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" and 2008's \"Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes\". In the fall of 2009, she appeared with the rest of the cast of *Seinfeld* in four episodes of the seventh season of Larry David's sitcom *Curb Your Enthusiasm*. The reunion shows received much media attention, and the episode received strong ratings for the series.\n\nIn 2009, Louis-Dreyfus was granted the honorary award for Legacy of Laughter at the TV Land Awards. Previous winners had included Lucille Ball and Mike Myers. She was presented with the award by friend Amy Poehler. The following year, Louis-Dreyfus received the 2,407th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 4, 2010, for her remarkable contribution to the broadcast television industry as both an actress and a comedian. Originally, the star was set with Louis-Dreyfus's name spelled incorrectly. It was missing both the 'o' and the hyphen in her last name. The star was corrected and the misspelled portion was removed and presented to her. Celebrity guests at the event included past and current colleagues from throughout her career, including Clark Gregg, Larry David, Eric McCormack, and Jason Alexander.\n\n*Old Christine* was cancelled by CBS on May 18, 2010, after 5 years. Discussions were held with ABC to revive the show but they never came to fruition. In the spring of 2010, Louis-Dreyfus guest-starred several times in the third season of the web series *Web Therapy*, starring Lisa Kudrow. Louis-Dreyfus played the sister of the main character, Fiona Wallice, who gives her therapy online. When the series made the transition to cable television on the Showtime network, Louis-Dreyfus's appearance from the web series was included in the second season, airing in July 2012\\. In fall 2010, Louis-Dreyfus made a guest appearance on the live episode of *30 Rock*, playing Tina Fey's role of Liz Lemon in the cutaway shots. Louis-Dreyfus was among several *Saturday Night Live* alumni appearing in the episode, including Rachel Dratch, Bill Hader, and regulars Tracy Morgan and Fey herself. Louis-Dreyfus also starred in a \"Women of SNL\" special on November 1, 2010, on NBC.\n\n### 2011\u20132019: *Veep* and acclaim\n\nIn May and June 2011, Louis-Dreyfus teamed up with husband Brad Hall for her first short film, *Picture Paris*. This was the first time the couple had collaborated since their early-2000s NBC comedy *Watching Ellie*. Hall wrote and directed the film, while Louis-Dreyfus played the lead role of an ordinary woman with an extraordinary obsession with the city of Paris. The film premiered on January 29, 2012, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and has received considerable critical acclaim. It made its television premiere on HBO on December 17, 2012\\.\n\nIn early 2011, HBO confirmed that Louis-Dreyfus had been cast in the lead role of U.S. Vice President Selina Meyer in a new satirical comedy series titled *Veep*. The series was commissioned for a first season of eight episodes. In addition to her starring role, Louis-Dreyfus would also be a producer. In preparation for her role, Louis-Dreyfus spoke with Al Gore and another former vice president, senators, speechwriters, chiefs of staffs of various offices, and schedulers. Louis-Dreyfus commended HBO for allowing the cast and crew to engage in a \"protracted pre-production process\", which included a six-week rehearsal period before filming began.\n\nThe first season was filmed in the fall of 2011, in Baltimore, and the series premiered on April 22, 2012\\. The premiere episode was met with high praise from critics, particularly for Louis-Dreyfus' performance. *The Hollywood Reporter* asserted the character of Selina Meyer was her \"best post-Seinfeld role\" to date and claimed she gives \"an Emmy-worthy effort\", while the *Los Angeles Times* contended the series demonstrates she is \"one of the medium's great comediennes.\" Following the success of the first season, Louis-Dreyfus was named by the *Huffington Post* as one of the funniest people of 2012, asserting that she is the \"most magnetic and naturally funny woman on TV since Mary Tyler Moore.\"\n\nFor her performance on *Veep*, Louis-Dreyfus received several accolades, most notably seven nominations for the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series between 2012 and 2019, winning the award six times. These Emmy wins for *Veep*, following previous wins for *Seinfeld* and *The New Adventures of Old Christine*, resulted in her becoming the only woman to win an acting award for three separate comedy series. Her sixth win in 2016 surpassed the record previously held by Mary Tyler Moore and Candice Bergen for the most wins in that category. In 2017, her sixth consecutive win, and eighth acting win, overall made her the performer with the most Emmys for the same role in the same series, surpassing Candice Bergen and Don Knotts, and put her in a tie with Cloris Leachman for the most Emmys ever won by a performer. She was also nominated as one of the producers for *Veep* in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category for all seven seasons, winning the award in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for the fourth, fifth and sixth seasons respectively. Louis-Dreyfus also received five Critics' Choice Television Award nominations, winning twice in 2013 and 2014, ten Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning twice in 2014 and 2017, and five Television Critics Association Award nominations, winning once in 2014\\.

In 2015 she acted in the Comedy Central sketch series *Inside Amy Schumer* alongside Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette, playing a version of themselves giving advice on aging to Amy Schumer. Dreyfus said of the experience \"I started to feel unbelievably paranoid that I was making fun of myself and wondering, was this really happening to me? Like, how meta is this moment in my life? I started to have a kind of soul-searching crisis in the middle of the day. And I didn't know \\[the other women] well enough to bring it up, so I was just trying to be a good sport even though I was dying a little bit on the inside.\" On April 16, 2016, she returned to *Saturday Night Live* serving as host for the third time with musical guest Nick Jonas. During the episode's cold open, she reprised her role of Elaine Benes from *Seinfeld*.\n\n### 2020\u2013present: Career expansion\n\nIn 2020, Louis-Dreyfus headlined the comedy-drama *Downhill*, opposite Will Ferrell.
