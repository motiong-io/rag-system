Generated answer: To answer your question, I need to follow a series of logical steps. 

First, based on your description of the Ancient Roman City being destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, I believe the city you are thinking of is either Pompeii or Herculaneum. 

Next, I know that the volcano responsible for the destruction of these cities is Mount Vesuvius, which is a stratovolcano.

Finally, to determine where the session was held where it was decided that Pompeii and Herculaneum would be named UNESCO World Heritage sites, I would need to look up information on UNESCO's recognition of these sites. According to UNESCO's website, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Torre Annunziata (the archaeological areas of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Torre Annunziata) were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980. The session where this decision was made was likely held at a meeting of the World Heritage Committee. The 4th session of the World Heritage Committee was held in Paris, France in 1980. Therefore, it is likely that the session where Pompeii and Herculaneum were named UNESCO World Heritage sites was held in Paris.
