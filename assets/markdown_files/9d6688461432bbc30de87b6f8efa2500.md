Former postal districts and their legacy
----------------------------------------

From 1923 until the introduction of the national postcode system in the late 1960s, Glasgow was divided into (mostly) numbered postal districts for its central and surrounding parts identified by compass-point letters: C1–C5 (corresponding to current postcode districts G1–G5\), W1–W5 (G11–G15\), NW (G20\), N1–N3 (G21–G23\), E1–E4 (G31–G34\), SE (G40\), S1–S6 (G41–G46\) and SW1–SW3 (G51–G53\).
