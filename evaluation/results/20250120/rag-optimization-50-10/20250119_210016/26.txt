It appears you've listed a series of dates, but without a specific context or question, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. However, I can attempt to find a connection or pattern among these dates.

1. **January 31, 1915** - Early in World War I.
2. **March 31, 1915** - Still within the first year of World War I.
3. **September 30, 1917** - During World War I, as the war was ongoing.
4. **May 31, 1931** - Post-World War I, during the interwar period.
5. **December 31, 1933** - As the world was moving towards World War II.
6. **September 30, 1936** - Early in the Spanish Civil War and pre-World War II.
7. **July 31, 1939** - Just before the start of World War II.
8. **April 30, 1942** - During World War II.
9. **October 31, 1944** - Towards the end of World War II.

These dates seem to span significant periods in the early 20th century, including both World War I and World War II, as well as the interwar period. Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what these dates are intended to represent or commemorate. If you have a specific question or need information on events occurring on or around these dates, please provide more details.
