The W222 was designed in 2009 by Korean designer Il-hun Yoon, who drew inspiration from the Mercedes-Benz F700 concept car. The exterior design was developed by a team under the direction of the Slovenian car designer Robert Le\u0161nik. The W222 has a similar design theme to the C-Class (W205\\) and E-Class (W213\\).\n\nIn Europe, sales of the S400 Hybrid, S350 BlueTEC, S350 BlueTEC Hybrid, and S500 began in September 2013, and sales of the S550 in the United States also began on that same month. The four-wheel drive *(4Matic)* model went on sale in November, and additional models, including V12 models and those from AMG, were released in 2014\\.\n\nThe W222 S-Class debuted on 15 May 2013, in Hamburg, Germany and entered production in Sindelfingen, Germany in June 2013\\.\n\nProduction of the W222 ended in September 2020 with the introduction of its successor, the S-Class (W223\\). \n\nSuspension\n----------\n\nMercedes' hydropneumatic, active suspension, *Active Body Control* has been updated with a system dubbed *Magic Body Control* (MBC), which is fitted with a road-sensing system (\"Road surface scan\") that pre-scans the road for uneven surfaces, potholes, and bumps. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph), and it adjusts the shock damping at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. As of 2017, MBC is not available on any of the 4Matic models.\n\nModels\n------\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled at Airbus in Hamburg-Finkewerder, followed by Shanghai's Mercedes-Benz Arena, and the 2013 Osaka Motor Show (S 400 HYBRID). The new S-Class became available to order in May 2013, with official arrival at Mercedes-Benz dealers on 20 July 2013\\. \n\nEarly models included S 400 Hybrid, S 500, S 350 BlueTEC, followed by the S 300 BlueTEC Hybrid in early 2014\\.\n\nUS models went on sale for the 2014 model year; the lineup initially included only the long-wheelbase \"S550\" (S500 in Europe) in September 2013, and the long-wheelbase S 550 4Matic, which arrived in November 2013\\. *Auto Bild* measured the LWB as the quietest among cars like the Rolls-Royce Ghost and the Bentley Flying Spur in 2014\\.\n\nEuropean models went on sale at the end of July 2013, followed by China at the end of September 2013, and the USA in October 2013\\.\n\nDelivery in Japan began in November 2013\\.

Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tests, the S 500 e has an all-electric range of 14 mi (23 km), with some gasoline consumption (0\\.1 gal/100 mi), so the actual all-electric range is rated between 0 to 12 mi (0 to 19 km).\n\nThe EPA, under its five-cycle tests, rated the 2015 model year S 500 e energy consumption in all-electric mode at 59 kWh per 100 miles, which translates into a combined city/highway fuel economy of 58 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (4\\.1 L/100 km; 70 mpg\u2212imp gasoline equivalent). When powered only by the gasoline engine, EPA's official combined city/highway fuel economy is 26 mpg\u2011US (9\\.0 L/100 km; 31 mpg\u2011imp).\n\nThe production vehicle was unveiled in Toronto in 2013, followed by the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.

Features include ECO start/stop function, optional touchpad, optional head-up display, Collision Prevention Assist Plus, and optional electric windscreen heating. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2014 North American International Auto Show. The vehicle went on sale in March 2014\\.\n\n### Mercedes-Maybach\n\nIn 2015, Mercedes brought back the Maybach name as a sub-brand of the Mercedes lineup. The first model produced was the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, designed to compete against the Bentley Mulsanne and Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII. At 5,453 mm (214\\.7 in) long with a wheelbase of 3,365 mm (132\\.5 in), the new model is approximately 20 cm (7\\.9 in) greater in both dimensions compared to the long-wheelbase S-Class models.\n\nThe Mercedes-Maybach is available in S 500 and S 600 models (the US received Mercedes-Maybach S 550 4MATIC and S 600 models, with the S 550 having the same 4\\.7L engine as the S 500 Mercedes-Maybach elsewhere), with 4MATIC optional with the V8 engine and V12 for the latter. Mercedes also claims that the S Class is the world's quietest production car. The basic car has colour options and the option of rear bench seats or 2 reclining rear seats. Options include air-conditioned, heated and massaging seats; heated armrests; a system to pump agarwood scented ionised air around the cabin; First class suite for the rear cabin and a 24-speaker, 1,540 watt Burmester High-End 3D surround sound system.\n\nAssembly of the Maybach S 500 started in Pune, India in September 2015 and it is the second country to produce a Maybach.\n\nIn 2017, the facelift S 600 was discontinued, while the S 650 was introduced (with the engine of the former S 65 AMG).\n\nThe Mercedes-Maybach S 600 and S 650 were also available in a Pullman version, a chauffeur-driven sedan that includes a partition-separated rear passenger compartment with two sets of paired-facing seats. This version is equipped with the V12 dual-turbocharger gasoline engine, the seven-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive. The same vehicle is additionally available as an armoured version, known as the Pullman Guard.\n\nAt the 2017 Shanghai Motor Show, a new Chinese-only Mercedes-Maybach S 680 was introduced for the 2018 model year and onward. The number 8 is very auspicious in China, and Asian countries is closely associated with luck and wealth, hence Mercedes' decision to name it as they did. The S 680 is essentially identical to the S 650 where equipment is concerned.\n\n* Mercedes-Maybach S 650 Pullman\n* Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Pullman\n\nSpecifications\n--------------\n\n### Engines (2013\u20132017\\)\n\n| Model | Years | Configuration | Displacement | Power | Torque | 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) | Top Speed (km/h) | Fuel Consumption/Efficiency (EU-Norm combined) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Petrol engines | | | | | | | | |\n| S 320 (China) | 2014\u20132017 | V6 (M 276 DE 30 AL) | 2,996 cc (182\\.8 cu in) | 200 kW (272 PS;

The refresh introduces the new 48-volt integrated starter/alternator, ENERGIZING Comfort Control, and updated autonomous driving technologies. The grille is updated to differentiate between six and eight-cylinder engine versions and long wheelbase and V12 versions. The headlamps and taillamps are also revised with new enhanced LED technology.\n\nThe new range of six-cylinder inline petrol and diesel engines are offered with electrification (20 kilowatts/22 horsepower). This marks the return of six-cylinder inline engines to the S-Class since the last one was offered in 2005\\. The engine is 2,999 cc (3\\.0 L) for both petrol and 2,927 cc (2\\.9 L) diesel engines. The sole gas V6 engine is in the S 560 e with a plug-in hybrid system. The four-cylinder inline engine with a hybrid system (S 300 h) was removed from the S-Class model range. Additionally, the old 4\\.7-litre V8 petrol engine is replaced by the new AMG-engineered 4\\.0-litre biturbo V8, consolidating the V8 engine range to one size now. 2019 marks the final year of the S 65 AMG with 130 units to be finished in obsidian black metallic paint with bronze highlights on the body and alloy wheels. However, the 6\\.0-litre V12 AMG carries on in the Maybach S 650 after the production of the S 65 AMG ended. Only the S 600 continues unchanged.\n\nInline 6 and V8 engines are now paired with the 9-speed 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission (AMG Speedshift MCT for S 63 AMG 4MATIC\\+) while V12 engines continue to use the 7G-TRONIC PLUS transmission.\n\nThe S 63 AMG 4MATIC\\+ became the sole choice for the V8 version of the S-Class from AMG, eliminating the previous rear-wheel-drive version. \n\n### Engines (2017\u20132020\\)\n\n| Model | Years | Configuration | Displacement | Power | Torque | 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) | Top Speed | Fuel Consumption/Efficiency(EU-Norm combined) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Petrol Engines | | | | | | | | |\n| S 320 (China) | 2017\u20132020 | I4 turbocharger (M264 E20 DEH LA) | 1,991 cc (121\\.5 cu in) | 220 kW (299 PS;

The S 680 is essentially identical to the S 650 where equipment is concerned.\n\n* Mercedes-Maybach S 650 Pullman\n* Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Pullman\n\nSpecifications\n--------------\n\n### Engines (2013\u20132017\\)", "contextualized_text": "The chunk describes the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class variants, specifically the Pullman version and the S 680 model, followed by engine specifications for the S-Class models from 2013 to 2017."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Mercedes-Benz_S-Class_(W222)_24", "original_index": 24, "content": "| Model | Years | Configuration | Displacement | Power | Torque | 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) | Top Speed (km/h) | Fuel Consumption/Efficiency (EU-Norm combined) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Petrol engines | | | | | | | | |\n| S 320 (China) | 2014\u20132017 | V6 (M 276 DE 30 AL) | 2,996 cc (182\\.8 cu in) | 200 kW (272 PS;
