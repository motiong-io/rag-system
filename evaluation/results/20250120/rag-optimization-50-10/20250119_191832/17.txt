Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to find the U.S. state capital city that meets two conditions:

1. The city is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference.
2. The mayor of the city attended the same university as at least one U.S. president.

From our previous conversation, we know that the U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference are:

1. Lincoln, Nebraska (University of Nebraska–Lincoln)
2. Columbia, Missouri (University of Missouri)
3. Austin, Texas (University of Texas at Austin)

Now, let's look at the universities attended by U.S. presidents:

* University of Texas at Austin: This university has no known direct connection to a U.S. president as an attendee.
* University of Missouri: This university has no known direct connection to a U.S. president as an attendee.
* University of Nebraska–Lincoln: This university has no known direct connection to a U.S. president as an attendee.

However, we do know that the University of Texas at Austin is located in Austin, Texas, and the mayor of Austin, Texas in August 2024 has the first name "Kirk". 

It turns out that Kirk Watson and Greg Abbott both have connections to the University of Texas and other presidents or presidential candidates have connections to it indirectly but one president did attend the University of Texas at Austin law school -  which is  Greg Abbott and also Lady Bird Johnson who was First Lady when Lyndon B Johnson was president and Lyndon B Johnson himself taught at the high school level and beyond but did attend and get his bachelor's degree from Southwest Texas State Teachers College which is now known as Texas State University.

So given this information and considering all possibilities - 
The first name of the mayor of the U.S. state capital city who attended the same university as at least one U.S. president and whose city is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference is Kirk.
