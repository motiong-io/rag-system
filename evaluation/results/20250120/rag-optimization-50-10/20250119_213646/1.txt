Generated answer: According to my knowledge, the Dewey Decimal Classification for the book "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë, published in 1847, is 823.8. 

If we assume that the height of the Bronte Tower is 823.8 feet, we can compare it to the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024.

As of my knowledge cutoff, the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City are:

1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet
2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet
3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet
4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet
5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet

Comparing the height of Bronte Tower (823.8 feet) to these buildings, it would not be among the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City.

However, to give a more accurate ranking, I would need more information on the heights of other buildings in New York City. But I can tell you that Bronte Tower would likely be a mid-to-high-rise building, but not among the supertalls.

If you'd like a more specific ranking, I can try to provide more information or context about building heights in New York City as of August 2024.
