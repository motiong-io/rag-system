{"doc_id": "List_of_Apollo_missions", "original_uuid": "2f58cea44090a505762fd6b387facf53", "content": "The Apollo program was a United States human spaceflight program carried out from 1961 to 1972 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which landed the first astronauts on the Moon. The program used the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles to lift the Command/Service Module (CSM) and Lunar Module (LM) spacecraft into space, and the Little Joe II rocket to test a launch escape system which was expected to carry the astronauts to safety in the event of a Saturn failure. Uncrewed test flights beginning in 1966 demonstrated the safety of the launch vehicles and spacecraft to carry astronauts, and four crewed flights beginning in October 1968 demonstrated the ability of the spacecraft to carry out a lunar landing mission.\n\nApollo achieved the first crewed lunar landing on the Apollo 11 mission, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their LM Eagle in the Sea of Tranquility and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the CSM Columbia, and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24, 1969\\. Five subsequent missions landed astronauts on various lunar sites, ending in December 1972 with twelve men having walked on the Moon and 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil samples returned to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history.\n\nTwo Apollo missions were failures: a 1967 cabin fire killed the entire Apollo 1 crew during a ground test in preparation for what was to be the first crewed flight; and the third landing attempt on Apollo 13 was aborted by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, which disabled the CSM *Odyssey'*s electrical power and life support systems, and made the propulsion system unsafe to use. The crew circled the Moon and were returned safely to Earth using the LM *Aquarius* as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions.\n\nUncrewed test flights\n---------------------\n\nFrom 1961 through 1967, Saturn launch vehicles and Apollo spacecraft components were tested in uncrewed flights.\n\n### Saturn I\n\nThe Saturn I launch vehicle was originally planned to carry crewed Command Module flights into low Earth orbit, but its 20,000-pound (9,100 kg) payload capacity limit could not lift even a partially fueled Service Module, which would have required building a lightweight retrorocket module for deorbit. These plans were eventually scrapped, in favor of using the uprated Saturn IB to launch the Command Module with a half-fueled Service Module for crewed Earth orbit tests. This limited Saturn I flights to Saturn launch vehicle development, CSM boilerplate testing, and three micrometeoroid satellite launches in support of Apollo.\n\nSaturn I missions\n\n| Mission | LV Serial No | Launch | Remarks | Refs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SA-1 | Saturn I SA-1 | October 27, 1961, 15:06 GMT Launch Complex 34 | Test of Saturn I first stage S-I; dummy upper stages carried water |  |\n| SA-2 | Saturn I SA-2 | April 25, 1962, 14:00 GMT Launch Complex 34 | Dummy upper stages released 22,900 U.S. gallons (86,685 L) of water into upper atmosphere, to investigate effects on radio transmission and changes in local weather conditions |  |\n| SA-3 | Saturn I SA-3 | November 16, 1962, 17:45 GMT Launch Complex 34 | Repeat of SA-2 mission |  |\n| SA-4 | Saturn I SA-4 | March 28, 1963, 20:11 GMT Launch Complex 34 | Test premature shutdown of a single S-I engine |  |\n| SA-5 | Saturn I SA-5 | January 29, 1964, 16:25 GMT Launch Complex 37B | First flight of live second stage.

This is due to AS-204 being renamed to Apollo 1 posthumously. This crewed flight was to have followed the first three uncrewed flights. After the fire which killed the AS-204 crew on the pad during a test and training exercise, uncrewed Apollo flights resumed to test the Saturn V launch vehicle and the Lunar Module; these were designated Apollo 4, 5 and 6\\. The first crewed Apollo mission was thus Apollo 7\\. Simple \"Apollo\" numbers were never assigned to the first three uncrewed flights, although renaming AS-201, AS-202, and AS-203 as Apollo 1-A, Apollo 2 and Apollo 3, had been briefly considered.\n\n### Saturn IB\n\nThe Saturn I was converted to the Uprated Saturn I, eventually designated Saturn IB, by replacing the S-IV second stage with the S-IVB, which would also be used as the third stage of the Saturn V with the addition of on-orbit restart capability. This increased the payload capacity to 46,000 pounds (21,000 kg), enough to orbit a Command Module with a half-fueled Service Module, and more than enough to orbit a fully fueled Lunar Module.\n\nTwo suborbital tests of the Apollo Block I Command and Service Module, one S-IVB development test, and one Lunar Module test were conducted. Success of the LM test led to cancellation of a planned second uncrewed flight.\n\nSaturn IB missions\n\n| Mission | LV Serial No | Launch | Remarks | Refs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AS-201 | Saturn IB SA-201 | February 26, 1966, 16:12 GMT Launch Complex 34 | First test of Saturn IB and Block I Apollo CSM.

These included simulated \"pad aborts\", which might occur while the Apollo-Saturn space vehicle was still on the launch pad, and flights on the Little Joe II rocket to simulate Mode I aborts which might occur while the vehicle was in the air.\n\nLaunch escape system tests\n\n| Mission | Launch vehicle | Launch | Remarks | Refs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| QTV | Little Joe II | August 28, 1963, 13:05 GMT Launch Complex 36 | Little Joe II qualification test |  |\n| Pad Abort Test 1 | None | November 7, 1963, 16:00 GMT Launch Complex 36 | Launch escape system (LES) abort test from launch pad |  |\n| A-001 | Little Joe II | May 13, 1964, 13:00 GMT Launch Complex 36 | LES transonic test, success except for parachute failure |  |\n| A-002 | Little Joe II | December 8, 1964, 15:00 GMT Launch Complex 36 | LES maximum altitude, Max-Q abort test |  |\n| A-003 | Little Joe II | May 19, 1965, 13:01 GMT Launch Complex 36 | LES canard maximum altitude abort test |  |\n| Pad Abort Test 2 | None | June 29, 1965, 13:00 GMT Launch Complex 36 | LES pad abort test of near Block-I CM |  |\n| A-004 | Little Joe II | January 20, 1966, 15:17 GMT Launch Complex 36 | LES test of maximum weight, tumbling Block-I CM |  |\n\n13:05 GMT Launch Complex 36\n\n16:00 GMT Launch Complex 36\n\n13:00 GMT Launch Complex 36\n\n15:00 GMT Launch Complex 36\n\n13:01 GMT Launch Complex 36\n\n13:00 GMT Launch Complex 36\n\n15:17 GMT Launch Complex 36\n\n### Saturn V\n\nPrior to George Mueller's tenure as NASA's Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight starting in 1963, it was assumed that 20 Saturn Vs, with at least 10 unpiloted test flights, would be required to achieve a crewed Moon landing, using the conservative one-stage-at-a-time testing philosophy used for the Saturn I. But Mueller introduced the \"all-up\" testing philosophy of using three live stages plus the Apollo spacecraft on every test flight. This achieved development of the Saturn V with far fewer uncrewed tests, and facilitated achieving the Moon landing by the 1969 goal. The size of the Saturn V production lot was reduced from 20 to 15 units.\n\nThree uncrewed test flights were planned to human-rate the super heavy-lift Saturn V which would take crewed Apollo flights to the Moon. Success of the first flight and qualified success of the second led to the decision to cancel the third uncrewed test.\n\nSaturn V missions\n\n| Mission | LV Serial No | Launch | Remarks | Refs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Apollo 4 | Saturn V SA-501 | November 9, 1967, 12:00 GMT Launch Complex 39A | First flight of Saturn V rocket; successfully demonstrated S-IVB third stage restart and tested CM heat shield at lunar re-entry speeds. |  |\n| Apollo 6 | Saturn V SA-502 | April 4, 1968, 16:12 GMT Launch Complex 39A | Second flight of Saturn V; severe \"pogo\" vibrations caused two second-stage engines to shut down prematurely, and third stage restart to fail.

An alphabetical list of major mission types was proposed by Owen Maynard in September 1967\\. Two \"A-type\" missions performed uncrewed tests of the CSM and the Saturn V, and one B-type mission performed an uncrewed test of the LM. The C-type mission, the first crewed flight of the CSM in Earth orbit, was performed by Apollo 7\\.\n\nThe list was revised upon George Low's proposal to commit a mission to lunar orbit ahead of schedule, an idea influenced by the status of the CSM as a proven craft and production delays of the LM. Apollo 8 was reclassified from its original assignment as a D-type mission, a test of the complete CSM/LM spacecraft in Earth orbit, to a \"C-prime\" mission which would fly humans to the Moon. Once complete, it obviated the need for the E-type objective of a medium Earth orbital test. The D-type mission was instead performed by Apollo 9; the F-type mission, Apollo 10, flew the CSM/LM spacecraft to the Moon for final testing, without landing. The G-type mission, Apollo 11, performed the first lunar landing, the central goal of the program.\n\nThe initial A\u2013G list was expanded to include later mission types::\u200a466 H-type missions\u2014Apollo 12, 13 (planned) and 14\u2014would perform precision landings, and J-type missions\u2014Apollo 15, 16 and 17\u2014would perform thorough scientific investigation. The I-type objective, which called for extended lunar orbital surveillance of the Moon, was incorporated into the J-type missions.:\u200a466\n\nAlphabetical mission types of the Apollo Program\n\n| Missions | Mission type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Apollo 4 * Apollo 6 | A | Unmanned flights of launch vehicles and the CSM, to demonstrate the adequacy of their design and to certify safety for men.\\[a] |\n| Apollo 5 | B | Unmanned flight of the LM, to demonstrate the adequacy of its design and to certify its safety for men. |\n| Apollo 7 | C | Manned flight to demonstrate performance and operability of the CSM. |\n| Apollo 8 | C\u2032 | Command and service module manned flight demonstration in lunar orbit.:\u200a466 |\n| Apollo 9 | D | Manned flight of the complete lunar landing mission vehicle in low Earth orbit to demonstrate operability of all the equipment and (insofar as could be done in Earth orbit) to perform the maneuvers involved in the ultimate mission. |\n| \u2014 | E | Manned flight of the complete lunar landing mission vehicle in Earth orbit to great distances from Earth. |\n| Apollo 10 | F | A complete mission except for the final descent to and landing on the lunar surface. |\n| Apollo 11 | G | The initial lunar landing mission. |\n| * Apollo 12 * Apollo 13 (planned) * Apollo 14 | H | Precision manned lunar landing demonstration and systematic lunar exploration.:\u200a466 |\n| \u2014 | I | Reserved for lunar survey missions.

The Block II spacecraft was designed to fly with the Lunar Module, so the corresponding crew positions were designated Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot regardless of whether a Lunar Module was present or not on any mission.\n\nSeven of the missions involved extravehicular activity (EVA), spacewalks or moonwalks outside of the spacecraft. These were of three types: testing the lunar EVA suit in Earth orbit (Apollo 9\\), exploring the lunar surface, and retrieving film canisters from the Scientific Instrument Module stored in the Service Module.\n\nCrewed missions\n\n| Mission | Patch | Launch date | Crew | Launch vehicle\\[b] | CM name | LM name | Duration | Remarks | Refs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Apollo 1 |  | February 21, 1967 Launch Complex 34 (planned) | Gus GrissomEd WhiteRoger B.

First, Apollo 20 was cut to make a Saturn V available to launch the Skylab space station whole instead of building it on-orbit using multiple Saturn IB launches. Eight months later, Apollo 18 and 19 were also cut to further economize, and because of fears of increased chance of failure with a large number of lunar flights.\n\nCanceled missions\n\n| As planned | | | | | | | As flown | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mission | Type | Date | Landing site | CDR | CMP | LMP | Mission | Launch date | Landing site | CDR | CMP | LMP |\n| Apollo 12\\[c] | H | November 1969 | Ocean of Storms | Pete Conrad | Richard F.
