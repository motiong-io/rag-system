According to the provided text, as of 2024, 30.6% of the population in New Jersey speaks a language other than English at home. This can be inferred from the statement that "English (only) 69.4%" are spoken, which implies that the remaining 30.6% speak a non-native language.

* Portuguese 0.91% 
* Italian 0.83% 
* Arabic 0.76%
