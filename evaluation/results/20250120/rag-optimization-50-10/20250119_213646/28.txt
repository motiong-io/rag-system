        obersevations:
        What year was William McCrary "Billy" Ray II born?:
William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born in 1963.

In what year was Obama first sworn in as President to the United States?:
According to the text, Barack Obama was first sworn in as President of the United States on January 20, 2009.

If you subtract 1963 from 2009 and multiply it by the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024, what number would you get?:
To calculate the result, we first need to subtract 1963 from 2009:

2009 - 1963 = 46

Then, we multiply this result by the number of administrative regions in France. As of my knowledge cutoff, France has 18 administrative regions (13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions). 

Assuming this number hasn't changed as of January 1, 2024:

46 * 18 = 828

So the result would be 828.


        


Generated answer: To calculate the result, we first need to subtract the year William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born (1963) from the year Obama was first sworn in as President (2009):

2009 - 1963 = 46

Then, we multiply this result by the number of administrative regions in France. As of my knowledge, France has 18 administrative regions (13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions). 

Assuming this number hasn't changed as of January 1, 2024:

46 * 18 = 828

So the result would be 828.

Check result: Y
