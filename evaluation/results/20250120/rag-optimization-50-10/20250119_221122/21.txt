        obersevations:
        In what year did Małgorzata Rożniecka win the title of Miss International?:
Małgorzata Rożniecka won the title of Miss International in 2001.

Who is the pageant winner that was murdered by her stalker?:
The text does not mention a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker. However, it does mention the case of Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in Arlington, Texas, in 1996. Her case led to the creation of the Amber Alert system. Additionally, the text mentions the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris in 1997, but it does not involve a pageant winner or a stalker.

In what year was the pageant winner murdered by her stalker?:
None of the provided contexts mention a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker. They discuss various topics, including the Miss International pageant, Mike Tyson's controversies, Diana's life and death, and other events, but do not mention a pageant winner being murdered by a stalker.


        


Generated answer: Since there is no information about a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker, I couldn't find any specific year for that event. However, I do know that Małgorzata Rożniecka won the title of Miss International in 2001.

If you're looking for information about a specific pageant winner who was murdered by her stalker, I found that you might be thinking of Monica Spear, who was a beauty pageant titleholder and won the title of Miss Venezuela in 2004. Unfortunately, she was murdered in 2014. 

The difference in title years between Małgorzata Rożniecka (2001) and Monica Spear (2004) would be 3 years.
