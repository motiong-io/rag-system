        In what year did Małgorzata Rożniecka win the title of Miss International?:
Małgorzata Rożniecka won the title of Miss International in 2001.

Who is the pageant winner that was murdered by her stalker?:
The text does not mention a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker. It does discuss the Miss International pageant, its history, and some controversies surrounding it, but it does not mention a winner being murdered. If you're thinking of a specific case, it might be the murder of JonBenét Ramsey, a child beauty pageant participant, or perhaps another case. If you have more information or context, I'd be happy to try and help you further.

In what year was a pageant winner murdered by her stalker?:
The text does not mention a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker. It does mention the murder of Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in Arlington, Texas, in 1996, but she was not a pageant winner at the time of her death.


        


Generated answer: Unfortunately, I don't have information on a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker, including the year of the incident. My previous observations only mentioned that the text does not discuss a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker.

However, I can tell you that Małgorzata Rożniecka won the title of Miss International in 2001. If you could provide more context or information about the pageant winner who was murdered by her stalker, I may be able to help you find the difference in title years.
