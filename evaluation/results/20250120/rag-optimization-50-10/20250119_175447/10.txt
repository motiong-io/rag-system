Generated answer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about the specific painting by the Australian artist that was featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923. The previous conversations didn't provide enough details to identify the artist or the painting. 

However, I can try to help you narrow down the possibilities. Based on our previous conversations, I mentioned two Australian women artists born in 1883: Dora Wilson and Belle Silva. If either of them was a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and had a painting featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923, it's possible that they might be the artist you're looking for.

To find the name of the painting, I would need more information or context about the artist or the magazine cover. If you have any additional details or clarification, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
