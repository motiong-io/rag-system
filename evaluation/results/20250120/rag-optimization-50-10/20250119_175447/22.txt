Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to consider the cities in Oklahoma that had a population of at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census. These cities are Oklahoma City and Norman.

According to the 1990 United States census, the population of Oklahoma City was approximately 444,719. The population of Norman in 1990 was around 80,071, which is less than 100,000. However, since Norman's population exceeded 100,000 in 2020, we still need to consider it for the calculation.

The total population of these cities in 1990 would be the sum of their individual populations: 444,719 (Oklahoma City) + 80,071 (Norman) = 524,790.

So, the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census was approximately 524,790 in the 1990 United States census.
