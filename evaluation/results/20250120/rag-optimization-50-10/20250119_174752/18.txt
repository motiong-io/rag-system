log:

Generated answer: Arlington is the 50th-most populous city in the United States. 
The city had a population of 398,431 in 2020. 
Arlington was formally incorporated on April 21, 1965, but it was first settled in the 1840s and was officially established as a township on November 8, 1846.

Frank Fox received UK Patent (1344259) in 1971 for an Improved Wheelchair.

If we consider Arlington's founding as its initial settlement or establishment as a township (in the 1840s or November 8, 1846), then Frank Fox received UK Patent (1344259) approximately 125 years later.
