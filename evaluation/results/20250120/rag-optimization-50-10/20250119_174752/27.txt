Ground truth: 9
log:

Generated answer: When Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC in the 1945-1947 period, squad numbers were not yet assigned to players based on their positions or roles. Instead, the numbering system was more traditional, with players wearing numbers 1-11.

As a centre-forward, Lawton would likely have worn the number 9 shirt, which was traditionally associated with the centre-forward position. However, it's worth noting that squad numbers were not always consistent during this period, and players may have worn different numbers in different games.

It wasn't until later, in the 1950s and 1960s, that squad numbers became more standardized and associated with specific positions. Even then, there was some variation between teams and leagues.

Check result: Y
