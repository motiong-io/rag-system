How many blue moons occurred on the 31st of the month out of January 31, 1915, March 31, 1915, and September 30, 1917?:
Two blue moons occurred on the 31st of the month: January 31, 1915, and March 31, 1915.


        


Generated answer: Based on the provided information, using the Pruett rule, I can see that there are several blue moons that occurred between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II. 

The ones that occurred on the 31st of the month are: 
1. January 31, 1915
2. March 31, 1915
3. October 31, 1925

Additionally, July 30 is close but not exactly on the 31st and April has a blue moon in '23 but it's also not exactly on '23's month-end.

So out of all these blue moons under Pruett rule within this time frame (WWI to WWII), there were at least three Blue Moons which fell exactly on a month's last day - which is always going be either a thirty or thirty-one since no months have more than thirty-one days.

Therefore, my answer would be: There were at least three Blue Moons under Pruett Rule during WWI to WWII time frame which fell exactly on a month's last day with date being 'the Thirty-First'.

Check result: N
