        obersevations:
        What year was William McCrary "Billy" Ray II born?:
William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born in 1963.

What year was Obama first sworn in as President to the United States?:
Barack Obama was first sworn in as President of the United States on January 20, 2009.

If you subtract 1963 from 2009 and multiply it by the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024, what number would you get?:
To find the result, we first subtract 1963 from 2009:
2009 - 1963 = 46

As of my cut-off knowledge in 2023, France had 18 administrative regions (13 metropolitan and 5 overseas). Assuming this number remains the same as of January 1, 2024:
18 (number of regions) * 46 (result of subtraction) = 828

So, the number you would get is 828.


        


Generated answer: To find the result, we first need to subtract the year William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born from the year Obama was first sworn in as President. 

William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born in 1963, and Obama was first sworn in as President in 2009. 

2009 - 1963 = 46

Then, we multiply this result by the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024, which is 18 (assuming the number remains the same).

18 * 46 = 828

So, the number you would get is 828.

Check result: Y
