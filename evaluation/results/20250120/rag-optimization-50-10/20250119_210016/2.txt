        obersevations:
        In what state is the US capitol located?:
The US Capitol is located in Washington, D.C., which is not a state but a federal district. It is not part of any state, but rather a separate entity that serves as the capital of the United States.

Where is Punxsutawney Phil located?:
Punxsutawney Phil is located in Young Township, near Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States. Specifically, he resides in a climate-controlled environment at the Punxsutawney Memorial Library, and on Groundhog Day, he emerges from his temporary home on Gobbler's Knob, which is located about 2 miles southeast of the town.

What is the birth year of Punxsutawney Phil, or the year he is considered to have started making predictions?:
Punxsutawney Phil is considered to have started making predictions in 1887, but according to the lore, he has been sustained by "groundhog punch" or "elixir of life" and has lived since 1886.

What year would Punxsutawney Phil have to start making predictions to coincide with a hypothetical Groundhog Day prediction in Washington, D.C. (considering it as if it were a state)?:
According to the text, the Groundhog Day celebration is rooted in Germanic tradition that says if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, winter and cold weather will last another six weeks. This tradition was brought to Pennsylvania by German immigrants.

The text also mentions that the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, and later moved to other locations, including Princeton, New Jersey, and Annapolis, Maryland, before ending up in New York City. Eventually, a permanent capital was established in Washington, D.C.

If we consider Washington, D.C. as a state and want Punxsutawney Phil's predictions to coincide with a hypothetical Groundhog Day prediction in Washington, D.C., we need to look for a year when the German immigrants might have brought this tradition to the area.

Given that the permanent capital was established in Washington, D.C. much later, and German immigrants initially settled in Pennsylvania, it's unlikely that Punxsutawney Phil would have started making predictions in Washington, D.C. during the 18th century.

However, if we assume that the tradition could have been brought to the area during the early years of the capital's establishment, Punxsutawney Phil would have to start making predictions around the late 18th century, possibly in the 1790s or early 1800s, to coincide with a hypothetical Groundhog Day prediction in Washington, D.C.


        


Generated answer: To determine how many years earlier Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive, we need to compare the year he is considered to have started making predictions (1887) with the year he would have to start making predictions to coincide with a hypothetical Groundhog Day prediction in Washington, D.C.

Assuming he would have to start making predictions in the late 18th century, possibly in the 1790s or early 1800s, let's take 1800 as a rough estimate.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

1887 (actual start year) - 1800 (hypothetical start year) = 87 years

So, Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive at least 87 years earlier to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol (if we consider Washington, D.C. as a state).
