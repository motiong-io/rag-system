Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to identify the oldest extant football team in Italy and the stadium they play in, as well as the person the stadium is named after.

The oldest extant football team in Italy is Genoa Cricket and Football Club, which was founded in 1893. However, another strong contender for this title is Internazionale's predecessor, which was formed in 1898 but split into two clubs (Inter and AC Milan) shortly after. But if we consider "extant" to mean still playing under their original name or a direct continuation of it without significant interruption or rebranding that alters their historical lineage significantly, then Genoa CFC could be considered among the oldest.

Genoa plays its home games at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The stadium is named after Luigi Ferraris, an Italian footballer who played for Genoa and died during World War I.

Luigi Ferraris was born on December 13, 1887. When he was 5 years old (in 1892), the emperor of China was Guangxu Emperor (reigning from 1875 to 1908).
