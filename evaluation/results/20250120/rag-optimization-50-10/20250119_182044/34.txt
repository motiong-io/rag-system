Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps.

First, we know that the oldest extant football team in Italy is Genoa Cricket and Football Club (Genoa C.F.C.). 

Next, Genoa C.F.C. plays in the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.

Then, we find out that the stadium is named after Luigi Ferraris, an Italian footballer.

Unfortunately, I don't have information about Luigi Ferraris' birth year. However, I can tell you that if I had his birth year or more context about him being 5 years old during a specific time period (e.g., which year), then I could look up who was the emperor of China at that time.

If you provide me with more context or details about Luigi Ferraris' age or birthdate when he was 5 years old (around which year), then I can try to help you identify who was the emperor of China at that specific point in time.

Check result: N
