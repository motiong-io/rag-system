His major works include *Mardock Scramble*, *Le Chevalier D'Eon* and *Heroic Age*. He also did series composition for the *Fafner in the Azure* series, *Ghost in the Shell: Arise*, *Psycho-Pass 2* and *Psycho-Pass 3*.\n\nEarly life\n----------\n\nUbukata was raised in Singapore and Nepal.\n\nCareer\n------\n\nIn high school, Ubukata received several writer's awards. In 1996, he debuted as a writer of short stories and won the Kadokawa Sneaker Award with his story *Black Season*. In 2009, he won the Eiji Yoshikawa Award for New Writers with his story *Tenchi Meisatsu*. In 2012, he won the F\u016btar\u014d Yamada Award for his story *Mitsukuni-den*.\n\nUbukata writes for the Japanese visual culture magazine *Newtype*. His serialized segments, called \"A Gambler's Life\", are comedic, often-satiric expository pieces. They chronicle his day-to-day experiences and interactions with people, such as his wife. In these segments, he dubs himself \"The Kamikazi Wordsmith\". These segments were also published in the American counterpart, Newtype USA, which is now discontinued.\n\nUbukata won the 24th Nihon SF Taisho Award in 2003\\. Ubukata has written the novelization and the script for the manga version of *Le Chevalier D'Eon*, and has contributed to the screenplay and the overall story plot of the animated version.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nOn August 21, 2015, Ubukata allegedly hit his then-wife in her jaw and mouth area at their home in Aoyama, Minato Ward of Tokyo, breaking her front tooth. She reported the incident to the police the next day, leading to his arrest on August 24, 2015\\. Ubukata admitted they had an argument but denied hitting her. On August 26, 2015, Mito City mayor Yasushi Takahashi decided to put NHK's offer to film a live-action taiga drama adaptation of Ubukuta's novel, *Mitsukuni-den*, in the city itself on hold. Ubukata was released on September 1, 2015 without indictment. The Public Prosecutors Office dropped charges against him in October 2015, with one reason being that his wife did not want to press charges. Following the incident, Ubukata announced that he planned on writing a memoir based on his experiences in jail, titled *9 Days Trapped*. In 2016, one year after his arrest and release, Ubukata revealed that he and his wife had divorced, with his wife taking custody of their children.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* *Tenchi Meisatsu*, 2009 (ISBN 9784048740135\\)\n* *Mitsukuni-den*, 2012 (ISBN 9784041102749\\)\n* *12 Suicidal Teens*, 2016 (ISBN 9784163905419\\)\n* *Ikusa no Kuni*, 2017 (ISBN 9784062208048\\)\n* *Kirinji*, 2018 (ISBN 9784041072141\\)\n* *Tsuki to Hi no Kisaki*, 2021 (ISBN 978-4-569-85009-2\\)\n* *SGU Metropolitan Police Department Special Gun Unit*, 2023 (ISBN 9784866997957\\)\n* *11 Rebels*, 2024 (ISBN 978-4-06-535708-8\\)\n\nFilmography\n-----------\n\n### Anime series\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006 | *Fafner in the Azure* | Series Composition, Script |  |\n| 2006 | *Le Chevalier D'Eon* | Original Creator, Series Composition, Script |  |\n| 2007 | *Heroic Age* | Original Creator, Series Composition |  |\n| 2013 | *Ghost in the Shell: Arise* | Series Composition, Script |  |\n| 2014 | *Psycho-Pass 2* | Series Composition |  |\n| 2019 | *Psycho-Pass 3* | Series Composition, Script |  |\n| 2022 | *RWBY: Ice Queendom* | Series Composition, Script |  |\n| 2024 | *Bye Bye, Earth* | Original Creator |  |\n| 2024 | *Moonrise* | Original Creator |  |\n\n### Anime films\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010 | *Mardock Scramble: The First Compression* | Original Creator, Script |  |\n| 2011 | *Mardock Scramble: The Second Combustion* | Original Creator, Script |  |\n| 2012 | *Mardock Scramble: The Third Exhaust* | Original Creator, Script |  |\n| 2015 | *Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie* | Script |  |\n| 2019 | *Human Lost* | Script |  |\n| 2020 | *Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector* | Series Composition, Script |  |\n| 2023 | *Psycho-Pass: Providence* | Series Composition, Script |  |\n\n### Live action\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012 | *Tenchi: The Samurai Astronomer* | Original Creator |  |\n| 2019 | *12 Suicidal Teens* | Original Creator |  |\n| 2021 | *Kenjusho: Mitsukuni Ko to Ore* | Original Creator |  |\n| 2023 | *Farewell, Guns Special Firearms Unit, Metropolitan Police Department* | Original Story |  |\n\n### Video games\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999 | *Shenmue* | Free Scenario Plotter |  |\n| 2001 | *Segagaga* | Story |  |\n| 2006 | *Culdcept Saga* | Script |  |",
