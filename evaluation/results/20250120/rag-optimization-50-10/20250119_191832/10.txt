Generated answer: Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to determine the name of the painting. The provided text doesn't mention the name of the Australian artist born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883) and a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. 

The text only mentions that Clarice Beckett (1887) was born 4 years after Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Cristina Asquith Baker (1868) was born 15 years before Janet Cumbrae Stewart, and Alice Marian Ellen Bale (1875) was born 8 years before Janet Cumbrae Stewart. None of these artists match the condition of being born in the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart.

Without knowing the name of the artist, I couldn't find any information about the painting featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923. If you have any more information or context, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
