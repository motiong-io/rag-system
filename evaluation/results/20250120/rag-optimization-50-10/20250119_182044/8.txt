Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. Identify the largest ward in Monaco: According to the observations, the largest ward in Monaco is Monte Carlo.
2. Identify the General Motors vehicle named after Monte Carlo: The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is named after Monte Carlo.
3. Determine the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo: The first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo is 1970.
4. As of 1970, determine how many people had walked on the moon: By 1970, several astronauts had walked on the moon as part of NASA's Apollo missions:
   - Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin (Apollo 11) in July 1969
   - Pete Conrad and Alan Bean (Apollo 12) in November 1969
   - Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell (Apollo 14) did not occur until February 1971, so they are not included in this count as of 1970.
   
So, by December 31st, 1969 but before any additional landings that may have occurred later than that date but still within 'model year' context for cars sold starting October or November '69 for '70 models... Four people had walked on the moon by that time frame relevant to when those specific cars were being made available at dealerships during their introductory period leading into calendar year '70 itself when considering typical automotive manufacturing timelines & retail sales cycles back then too!
