Question: Which species from the genus mulona are both found in the same country?
Ground truth: Mulona barnesi and mulona schausi
log:

Generated answer: There is no genus called "mulona." It's possible that you may be thinking of a different genus, such as "Mullerornis" or "Mulona," but without more information, it's difficult to provide a specific answer.

However, I found that there is a genus called "Mulona" in the family Erebidae (moth family), but I couldn't find any information on the distribution of species within this genus.

If you could provide more context or clarify which genus you are referring to, I'll do my best to help.

Check result: N
