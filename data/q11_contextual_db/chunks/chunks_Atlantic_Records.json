        "content": "Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson. Over the course of its first two decades, starting from the release of its first recordings in January 1948, Atlantic earned a reputation as one of the most important American labels, specializing in jazz, R&B, and soul by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding. Its position was greatly improved by its distribution deal with Stax. In 1967, Atlantic became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Led Zeppelin, and Yes.\nIn 2004, Atlantic and its sister label Elektra were merged into the Atlantic Records Group. Craig Kallman is the chairman of Atlantic. Ahmet Ertegun served as founding chairman until his death on December 14, 2006, at age 83.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\nIn 1944, brothers Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegun remained in the United States when their mother and sister returned to Turkey after the death of their father Munir Ertegun, Turkey's first ambassador to the U.S. The brothers were fans of jazz and rhythm & blues, amassing a collection of over 15,000 78 RPM records. Ahmet ostensibly stayed in Washington to undertake post-graduate music studies at Georgetown University but immersed himself in the Washington music scene and entered the record business, which was enjoying a resurgence after wartime restrictions on the shellac used in manufacture. He convinced the family dentist, Vahdi Sabit, to invest $10,000 and hired Herb Abramson, a dentistry student.\nAbramson had worked as a part-time A&R manager/producer for Al Green at the jazz label National Records, signing Big Joe Turner and Billy Eckstine. He founded Jubilee in 1946 but had no interest in its most successful musicians. In September 1947, he sold his share in Jubilee to his partner, Jerry Blaine, and invested $2,500 in Atlantic.\nAtlantic was incorporated in October 1947 and was run by Abramson (president) and Ertegun (vice-president in charge of A&R, production, and promotion). Abramson's wife Miriam ran the label's publishing company, Progressive Music, and did most office duties until 1949 when Atlantic hired its first employee, bookkeeper Francine Wakschal, who remained with the label for the next 49 years. Miriam gained a reputation for toughness. Staff engineer Tom Dowd recalled, \"Tokyo Rose was the kindest name some people had for her\" and Doc Pomus described her as \"an extraordinarily vitriolic woman\". When interviewed in 2009, she attributed her reputation to the company's chronic cash-flow shortage: \"... most of the problems we had with artists were that they wanted advances, and that was very difficult for us ... we were undercapitalized for a long time.\" The label's office in the Ritz Hotel in Manhattan proved too expensive, so they moved to a room in the Hotel Jefferson. In the early fifties, Atlantic moved from the Hotel Jefferson to offices at 301 West 54th St and then to 356 West 56th St.\nAtlantic's first recordings were issued in late January 1948 and included \"That Old Black Magic\" by Tiny Grimes and \"The Spider\" by Joe Morris. In its early years, Atlantic concentrated on modern jazz although it released some country and western and spoken word recordings. Abramson also produced \"Magic Records\", children's records with four grooves on each side, each groove containing a different story, so the story played would be determined by the groove in which the stylus happened to land.\nIn late 1947, James Petrillo, head of the American Federation of Musicians, announced an indefinite ban on all recording activities by union musicians, and this came into effect on January 1, 1948. The union action forced Atlantic to use almost all its capital to cut and stockpile enough recordings to last through the ban, which w\nAtlantic Music Group LLC is an umbrella label owned by Warner Music Group. It oversees several labels assigned to its Atlantic Records unit. In total, the label group has nearly three hundred artists on its roster.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004, Time Warner sold Warner Music to a group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its sister, Elektra Records, to form The Atlantic Records Group. Upon the merger, Elektra became largely dormant, with most of its retained roster absorbed by Atlantic.  In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: Roadrunner Records, Fueled by Ramen, Custard Records and Maybach Music Group. Elektra was reactivated as a brand of Atlantic Records Group in 2009. The same year Atlantic's dance and hip hop imprint Big Beat Records, which scored notable success for most of the 1990s (but had been in hibernation since 1998) was also relaunched.\nOn June 18, 2018,  Warner Music Group announced the formation of Elektra Music Group to be launched as a stand-alone, independently managed primary label at WMG on October 1.  Splitting off from Atlantic Records Group, EMG will take with it five labels that previously operated under the Atlantic group (including Elektra Records), three label staff, and a handful of major artists. Elektra's independence renews the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic) triad that had for decades mark the original company organization. Elektra co-presidents, however, will answer to Atlantic Records Group Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman and Chairman/COO Julie Greenwald.\nIn 2020, Atlantic Records announced the relaunching of its original subsidiary label Atco Records, under the authority of its A&R President Pete Ganbarg. This reactivation of Atco Records marks the first time in over 25 years that the label has actively operated under the Atlantic Records umbrella.\n\n\n== Labels ==\nAvang Music\nAsylum Records\nAtco Records\nAtlantic Records\nBig Beat Records\nCustard Records\nFNC Entertainment\nHitmaker Records\nLaSalle Records\nMaybach Music Group\nOwsla\nUpFront Records\nX5 Music Group\nTaylor Gang Records\nGeneration Now\n10K Projects\n\n\n== Atlantic Records UK ==\n\nAtlantic Records UK is a British record label used as copyright-holder for UK releases on the Atlantic label. It was founded in June 2004 when Warner Music Group bought East West Records from Time Warner and rebranded its UK operation. The first Chairman was Max Lousada, previously Head of A&R at Mushroom Records UK and, as of June 2019, chairman and CEO Warner Music UK. In 2011 Atlantic Records UK was named Label of the Year at the Music Week Awards. In the same year, The Guardian put Lousada joint 20th in its \"Music Power 100\" list of influential figures in the UK music industry. He shared his place with John Reid and Christian Tattersfield, both from Warner. In October 2011, the7stars advertising agency announced it had won a pitch to handle Atlantic Records UK's £2 million media planning and buying account, taking over from ZenithOptimedia. In 2014, Ben Cook was appointed president, Atlantic Records UK, reporting to Lousada. In 2019, the label was reconfigured around A&R, Promotions, Marketing, Publicity, Creative and Audience.\nBy 2010, their artists included Flo Rida, Jay-Z, T.I., Lupe Fiasco, B.o.B, Missy Elliott and Plan B and by 2014 the list included Paolo Nutini, Ed Sheeran, Birdy, Rudimental, Marina and the Diamonds, Rumer, Twenty One Pilots, Lykke Li, Santigold and Clean Bandit.

Retrieve\nAs of May 2024, there have been 1,727 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity, 960 at hurricane intensity, and 333 at major hurricane intensity within the Atlantic Ocean since 1851, the first Atlantic hurricane season to be included in the official Atlantic tropical cyclone record. Though a majority of these cyclones have fallen within climatological averages, prevailing atmospheric conditions occasionally lead to anomalous tropical systems which at times reach extremes in statistical record-keeping including in duration and intensity. The scope of this list is limited to tropical cyclone records solely within the Atlantic Ocean and is subdivided by their reason for notability.\n\n\n== Tropical cyclogenesis ==\n\n\n=== Most active / least active Atlantic hurricane seasons ===\nMost Atlantic hurricane seasons prior to the weather satellite era include seven or fewer recorded tropical storms or hurricanes. As the usage of satellite data was not available until the mid-1960s, early storm counts are less reliable. Before the advent of the airplane or means of tracking storms, the ones recorded were storms that affected mainly populated areas. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated.\nWith the advent of the satellite came better and more accurate weather tracking. The first satellites sent into space to monitor the weather were known as Television Infrared Observation Satellites (TIROS). In 1961, Hurricane Esther was the first hurricane to be \"discovered\" through satellite readings. Although this modern invention was now available, the systems were initially not fully active enough to provide daily images of the storms. Data for the North Atlantic region remained sparse as late as 1964 due to a lack of complete satellite coverage.\nDue to the above factors, terms such as \"ever\" or \"on record\" should be interpreted to mean \"since sometime between 1964 and 1978\".\nThe most active Atlantic hurricane season on record in terms of total storms took place in 2020, with 30 documented. The storm count for the 2020 season also includes fourteen hurricanes, of which seven strengthened to major hurricane status. On the converse, the least active season on record in terms of total storms took place in 1914. The 1914 season had just one tropical storm and no hurricanes.\n\n\n=== Earliest / latest formations for each category ===\n\nClimatologically speaking, approximately 97 percent of tropical cyclones that form in the North Atlantic develop between June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though the beginning of the annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of October 31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season; as of 2023 there have been 92 tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being an unnamed subtropical storm in January 2023. The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on January 3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December 2012. Hurricane Able in 1951 was initially thought to be the earliest forming major hurricane; however, following post-storm analysis, it was determined that Able only reached Category 1 strength, which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder, as it became a major hurricane on June 8. Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season, Hurricane Audrey in 1957 was the earliest developing Category 4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June 27. However, reanalysis of 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record in the calendar year on July 8, 2005. That mark stood until s\nThis is a list of artists who record, or who have recorded, for Atlantic Records. a division of Warner Music Group.

Two of the major series of LP recordings were the \"1200\" and \"8000\" series, started by Nesuhi Ertegun. The \"1200\" series was reserved for jazz albums. The \"8000\" and subsequent series, started shortly after the 1200 in 1956, featured Atlantic's R&B and pop albums; when the \"1200\" series was discontinued in the 1970s, the jazz albums were mixed with the R&B and pop albums in their respective series. This list includes albums using Atlantic's numbering system that were released under their numerous subsidiary labels. There is a section containing albums related to the label as well.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== 100 & 400 10-inch LP Series ===\nAtlantic's first 33⅓ RPM LP records were 10-inch albums and their first release in 1949 was a recording of Walter Benton's poetry set to music which was also issued as three 12 inch 78 RPM records. This was followed by two albums in 1950 with the bulk of Atlantic's 10-inch albums released between 1951 and 1953. The 100 Series released mainly instrumental jazz LPs and the 400 Series featured vocalists. The album catalog numbers were often denoted by the prefix \"LP\" on the album cover and \"ALS\" or \"ALR\" on the record label.\n\n\n=== The 1200 – 1700 series ===\nAtlantic commenced releasing 12 inch LP records with the establishment of their 1200 series in 1949 with an album consisting of three 78 RPM records of Walter Benton's poetry. This was followed by a two record set of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in 1951. Subsequent releases featured Dixieland, opera and selections from Broadway musicals before Nesuhi Ertegun took over responsibility for the LP series in 1955 and the series focused almost exclusively on jazz releases. After one a very early experiment in 1953 stereo releases of Atlantic LPs began production in 1958 and by 1960 all releases were available in mono or stereo pressings—indicated by the prefix SD on the catalog number. The series continued until late 1977 when it concluded with SD 1700 and most of the popular jazz artists moved to the SD 18100 Series and a limited number of albums were released on the 8800 Series.\n\n\n==== 1200 series ====\n\n\n==== 1300 series ====\n\n\n==== 1400 series ====\n\n\n==== 1500 series ====\n\n\n==== 1600 series ====\n\n\n=== 8800 series ===\n\n\n=== 3000 series ===\nA small run of eight jazz LPs released between 1965 and 1967.\n\n\n=== 8000 \"Popular\" Series ===\nAtlantic commenced releasing 12-inch LPs of popular music in 1956 with the 8000 Series collections of hit singles by their roster of established rhythm and blues artists. The 1960s saw the expansion of Atlantic's roster with the addition of popular music performers, international artists and the emerging dominance of soul music singers such as Solomon Burke and Aretha Franklin. By the end of the 1960s the label experienced its greatest commercial success breaking rock music supergroups like Led Zeppelin and Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\n\n=== 7200–7311 ===\nSD-7200 – Déjà Vu – Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young [1970]\nSD-7201 – Led Zeppelin III – Led Zeppelin [1970]\nSD-7202 – Stephen Stills – Stephen Stills [1970]\nSD-7203 – If I Could Only Remember My Name – David Crosby [1971]\nSD-7204 – Songs For Beginners – Graham Nash [1971]\nSD-7205 – Live At Fillmore West – Aretha Franklin [1971]\nSD-7206 – Stephen Stills 2 – Stephen Stills [1971]\nSD-7207 – Soul To Soul – Various Artists [1971]\nSD-7208 – Led Zeppelin IV (Untitled) – Led Zeppelin [1971]\nSD-7209 – The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman By \"J\" – Tony Camillo [1971]\nSD-7210 – All In the Family (TV Soundtrack) – Carroll O'Connor and Others [1971]\nSD-7211 – Fragile – Yes [1971]\nSD-7212 – Islands – King Crimson [1972]\nSD-7213 – Young, Gifted and Black – Aretha Franklin [1972]\nLD-7214 – FM and AM – George Carlin [1972] The label on this album is Little David Records.\nSD-7215 – Good Ol' Boys – Harold Griffiths [1/72]\nSD-7216 – Roberta \nWarner Music Group Corp., commonly abbreviated as WMG, is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (later known as WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThe film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio's machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.\nAfter Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG's oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\nAtlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T & the MGs, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed WEA Music of Canada, Ltd. (French: WEA Musique du Canada, Ltée) as the Canadian branch of the WEA (Warner, El\nWarner Records Inc. (known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label.  A subsidiary of the Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.\nArtists who have recorded for Warner Records include  Madonna, Prince, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane's Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., Bob James, David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAt the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.\nIn 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.\nIn December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick's pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.\n\n\n=== 1958–1963: formation and early years ===\n  \nWarner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance—the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business—lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.\nIn 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business—Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen & Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment \nOn May 14, 1988, the Atlantic Records label held its 40th-anniversary celebration by staging, at Madison Square Garden, New York, a non-stop concert lasting almost 13 hours starting at noon and ending just shortly before 1 am the following morning. The event was dubbed \"It's Only Rock And Roll\".\nOnly artists who had released material on the Atlantic label in the United States performed, spanning the company's forty-year existence. Lavern Baker and Ruth Brown were the longest tenured Atlantic acts to perform, while Debbie Gibson was the most recent.\nSome Atlantic signings, who had either officially split up or not performed together for a number of years, re-formed especially to perform. These included The Rascals, Iron Butterfly, and the former members of Led Zeppelin. Other notable performers included Yes, Genesis, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer (representing Emerson, Lake & Palmer), Foreigner, Paul Rodgers, Bob Geldof, Booker T. Jones, Wilson Pickett, The Coasters, The Spinners, Phil Collins, Peabo Bryson, The Blues Brothers (featuring Dan Aykroyd and Sam Moore), Roberta Flack, The Manhattan Transfer, Bee Gees, Ben E. King, and Vanilla Fudge.\nPlans to close the performance with a greatest hits all-star jam were shelved. Instead, the former members of Led Zeppelin were the last act. \"No rehearsal and just shambling on,\" recalled guitarist Jimmy Page.\nThe concert was broadcast live in the US on FM radio and HBO television; commentary for the latter being provided backstage by comedian Robert Townsend. HBO commenced its live broadcast a few hours into the event and interspersed footage of the concert that had been taped earlier by the network. In so doing, some of the artists' sets were edited or omitted. An edited version aired later that year on ABC hosted by Robert Hays.

Founded in 1957 as Satellite Records, the label changed its name to Stax Records in September 1961. It also shared its operations with sister label Volt Records.\nStax was influential in the creation of Southern soul and Memphis soul music. Stax also released gospel, funk, and blues recordings. Renowned for its output of blues music, the label was founded by two siblings and business partners, Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton (STewart/AXton = Stax). It featured several popular ethnically integrated bands (including the label's house band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s) and a racially integrated team of staff and artists unprecedented in that time of racial strife and tension in Memphis and the South. According to ethnomusicologist Rob Bowman, the label's use of \"one studio, one equipment set-up, the same set of musicians and a small group of songwriters led to a readily identifiable sound. It was a sound based in black gospel, blues, country, and earlier forms of rhythm and blues (R&B). It became known as southern soul music.\"\nFollowing the death of Stax's biggest star, Otis Redding, in 1967, and the severance of the label's distribution deal with Atlantic Records in 1968, Stax continued primarily under the supervision of a new co-owner, Al Bell. Over the next five years, Bell expanded the label's operations significantly, in order to compete with Stax's main rival, Motown Records in Detroit. During the mid-1970s, a number of factors, including a problematic distribution deal with CBS Records, caused the label to slide into insolvency, resulting in its forced closure in late 1975.\nIn 1977, Fantasy Records acquired the post-1968 Stax catalogue and selected pre-1968 recordings. Beginning in 1978, Stax (now owned by Fantasy) began signing new acts and issuing new material, as well as reissuing previously recorded Stax material. However, by the early 1980s, no new material was being issued on the label, and for the next two decades, Stax was strictly a reissue label.\nAfter Concord Records acquired Fantasy in 2004, the Stax label was reactivated, and is today used to issue both the 1968–1975 catalog material and new recordings by current R&B and soul performers. Atlantic Records continues to hold the rights to the vast majority of the 1959–1968 Stax material.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1957–1960: early years as Satellite Records ===\n\nStax Records, originally named Satellite Records, was founded in Memphis in 1957 by Jim Stewart, initially operating in a garage. Satellite's early releases were country music, rockabilly records or straight pop numbers, reflecting the tastes of Stewart (a country fiddle player) at the time.\nIn 1958, Stewart's sister Estelle Axton began her financial interest in the company. Taking a considerable financial risk, she mortgaged her family home to invest US$2,500 (US$26,401 in 2023 dollars) in the company, enabling Satellite to purchase an Ampex 350 mono console tape recorder.\nThe company set up a small recording studio in a converted garage near National Cemetery in Brunswick, Tennessee, in 1959. In 1970, Stewart recalled this portion of the label's origins, and remarked, \"I don't even remember the address. We didn't have any sound equipment or anything else but a small building and a lot of desire.\"\nAround this time, Stewart was introduced to rhythm and blues music by staff producer Chips Moman. In the summer of that year, Satellite released its first record by a rhythm and blues act, \"Fool in Love\", by the Veltones, which was soon picked up for national distribution by Mercury Records. However, Satellite remained primarily a country and pop label for the next year or so.\nWhile promoting \"Fool in Love\", Stewart met with Memphis disc jockey and R&B singer Rufus Thomas, and both parties were impressed by the other. Around the same time, and at the urging of Chips Moman, Stewart moved the company back to Memphis and into an old movie theat\nBig Beat Records, Inc. is an American electronic and dance music record label, owned by Warner Music Group and operates through Atlantic Records. It was founded as an independent record label in 1986 by Craig Kallman with an emphasis on house music, and later hip hop. It was absorbed into Atlantic Records in 1998, and eventually relaunched separately in 2010 as a primarily electronic music label. Its current roster includes 100 gecs, Dog Blood, Galantis, Whethan, Cash Cash, and Clean Bandit.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1987–1998: Original Big Beat ===\nThe first iteration of Big Beat was founded as an Independent record label in 1986 by Craig Kallman who was, at the time, a 20-year-old deejay in New York City. The company initially operated out of Kallman's bedroom where he recorded the label's first track, \"Join Hands\" by Taravhonty, which sold 5,000 copies largely through direct promotion at record stores by Kallman himself.\nThe second record Kallman recorded in his bedroom studio was titled \"The Party\" by Kraze which would go on to sell 250,000 units in the United States and internationally. Soon after, Kallman began focusing on developing the record label, signing acts like Tara Kemp and Jomanda over the following three years. He would sell Kemp's contract to Giant in 1991. Also that year, Jomanda released a record entitled \"Got a Love for You\" on Big Beat which attracted the attention of Doug Morris, the co-chairman of Atlantic Records at the time. Atlantic acquired Big Beat and made Kallman the Vice President of A&R while he still operated Big Beat.\nAs the 1990s escalated, the label's roster shifted from primarily house music to more hip hop music. Big Beat signed a variety of artists including Mad Skillz, Changing Faces, Robin S., Fat Joe, Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lil' Kim (both via the company's Undeas imprint), Artifacts, Art n' Soul, Double X Posse, Kenny Dope, Dawn Penn, Marshall Jefferson, Todd Terry, Quad City DJs, Percee P, and numerous others.\nIn 1997, the label signed Fat Joe. The label found success with Fat Joe with his third studio album Don Cartagena, released in September 1998. The album was top 10 on the Billboard 200, and was certified Gold by the RIAA.\nIn 1998, the label and its roster were absorbed into Atlantic Records. In 2001, an attempt to relaunch Big Beat was planned, but ultimately abandoned.\n\n\n=== 2010–present: Relaunch ===\nBig Beat was relaunched under Atlantic Records as a dance-focused label in 2010. Artists on the label at the time of the relaunch included Skrillex, Chromeo, Wynter Gordon, Martin Solveig, Teddybears, and others. The relaunched label's first hit came in 2010 with Wynter Gordon's \"Dirty Talk\" which reached #1 on the ARIA singles chart and the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart and was certified triple platinum in Australia. Martin Solveig's song \"Hello,\" which was released in 2011 in the United States, peaked at #46 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at #1 on the Dance Club Songs chart while also achieving Platinum status from the RIAA.\nSkrillex's Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP, released in 2010, effectively charted the label's trajectory toward electronic music. The EP sold hundreds of thousands of copies and its title track sold over 2 million copies and appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012, the EP was named the Best Dance/Electronic Album and its title track won Best Dance Recording. The following year at the 55th Grammy Awards, Skrillex again won Best Dance/Electronic Album for his Bangarang EP along with Best Dance Recording for the EP's title track which featured Sirah. He also won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his and Nero's remix of the Nero song, \"Promises\".\nIn 2013, Big Beat signed Icona Pop, a Swedish electropop duo that would go on to release the 4× Platinum \"I Love It\" featuring Charli XCX. The label also signed Cash Cash—whose 2013 single, \"Take Me Home\" featuring Bebe Rexha, was certified Platinum— and Galan\nElektra Records (or Elektra Entertainment) is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group, founded in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt. It played an important role in the development of contemporary folk and rock music between the 1950s and 1970s. In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG's Atlantic Records Group. After five years of dormancy, the label was revived as an imprint of Atlantic in 2009. In October 2018, Elektra was detached from the Atlantic Records umbrella and reorganized into Elektra Music Group, once again operating as an independently managed frontline label of Warner Music. In June 2022, Elektra Music Group was merged with 300 Entertainment to create the umbrella label 300 Elektra Entertainment (3EE), though both Elektra and 300 continued to maintain their separate identities as labels.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950–1971: Founding and early history ===\nElektra was formed in 1950, as the Elektra-Stratford Record Corporation, with a singles label called Stratford Records, by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt in Holzman's St. John's College dorm room. Each invested $300. The usual spelling of the Greek mythological Pleiad Electra was changed. Holzman famously explained, \"I gave her the 'K' that I lacked\". He found the 'C' in the original name \"too soft\", but liked the \"solid bite\" of the letter 'K', citing its use in the Kodak name.\nThe first Elektra LP, New Songs (EKLP 1 released March 1951), was a collection of Lieder and similar art songs, which sold few copies. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the label concentrated on folk music recordings, releasing a number of best-selling albums by Theodore Bikel, Ed McCurdy, Oscar Brand, and Judy Collins, and protest singers such as Phil Ochs and Tom Paxton. Holzman also recorded Josh White, who was without a record deal as a result of McCarthyite blacklisting.\n\nIn 1964, Elektra launched Nonesuch Records. This classical budget label was the best-selling budget classical label of the era. Other labels followed suit by starting their own budget series, but Nonesuch remained the most popular and Jac Holzman states in his book that profits from the budget classical label made it possible for Elektra to experiment with their pop releases by the mid-1960s.\nIn 1965, Elektra began a short-lived joint venture with Survey Music called Bounty Records, which was Elektra's first foray into pop music. The most notable signing for Bounty was the Paul Butterfield Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded.\nElektra's entrance into pop gained the label considerable prestige within the music scene by being one of the first labels to sign up leading acts from the new wave of American psychedelic rock of 1966–1967. The label's most important signings were the Chicago-based Paul Butterfield Blues Band (with Mike Bloomfield), the Los Angeles bands Love and The Doors, and the Detroit bands The Stooges and MC5. Included in Elektra's Los Angeles-based signings were Tim Buckley and Bread. In 1968, the label also signed pioneering rock guitar soloist Lonnie Mack to a three-album deal.\nAlso in 1967, Elektra launched its Nonesuch Explorer Series, one of the first collections of what is now referred to as world music. Excerpts from several Nonesuch Explorer recordings were later included on the two Voyager Golden Discs, which were sent into deep space in 1977 aboard the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes.\n\n\n=== 1971–1989: Elektra/Asylum Records ===\nElektra, along with its Nonesuch Records subsidiary, was acquired by Kinney National Services in 1970, which changed its name to Warner Communications in 1972. Soon afterwards, Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with Asylum Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records; Asylum's founder, David Geffen, headed the newly combined label. Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for Warner — us\nAtlantic Records Russia (known until 24 March 2021 as Zhara Music) was a Russian music label, one of the branches of Atlantic Records. The company took part in music distribution, bookings, promotion of artists, music content and organizational activities. The label's artists included Morgenshtern, HammAli & Navai, Emin, Bahh Tee, Rauf & Faik, Jony, ЛСП, Dava, Johnyboy, RaiM & other musicians.\n\n\n== History ==\nZhara Music (2018–2020)\nOn 15 June 2018, Emin Agalarov, vice-president of the holding Crocus Group, better known as Emin, released the song «Невероятная». This release started the music label Zhara Music. The partner for helping the project was Russian singer Bakhtar Aliyev, also known by his stage name Bahh Tee, also the owner of music label Siyah Music.\n\nAtlantic Records Russia (2021–2022)\nOn March 24, 2021, it became known about the purchase of the Warner Music Group label, on its basis the Russian division of the American label Atlantic Records, which is part of the Warner Music group of companies, was created. Bakhtiyar Aliyev headed the newly created label. Later, the approximate cost of acquiring the record company became known - $25,000,000. Later, the collection Atlantic Records Russia: F1rst Blood was released to coincide with the creation of a new label.\nOn February 24, 2022, a message appeared in the official Atlantic Records Russia VKontakte group about the cancellation of all upcoming releases and the postponement of their premieres for an indefinite period. On March 10, 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Atlantic's parent organization and distributor, Warner Music Group, announced the suspension of operations in Russia, including investment and project development, advertising and marketing activities, and the production of all physical products.\nOn 1 March 2023, Bahh Tee stepped down from his position as CEO of Atlantic Records Russia. He created a new label, Lotus Music.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\nLists of Atlantic Records artists include artists who record or have recorded for Atlantic Records.\n\nAtlantic Records discography\nList of Atlantic Records artists\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtlantic Records\nAaron Bay-Schuck (born September 5, 1981) is an American music industry executive. The CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records (formerly Warner Bros. Records), he was previously the president of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M and the senior vice president of A&R at Atlantic Records.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBay-Schuck was born in Los Angeles to actors Susan Bay and John Schuck. His parents divorced when he was a child, and in 1989 his mother married actor Leonard Nimoy. His mother is a cousin of film director and producer Michael Bay.\nBay-Schuck attended Columbia University, where he majored in political science. He planned to attend law school and pursue a career in entertainment law. In his senior year, he met a video promotion executive from Capitol Records and had a conversation with her about how record companies operate. The next day he applied for an internship at Interscope Records. He was hired, and although he interned in the video promotion department, he became interested in A&R. He graduated from Columbia in 2003.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Atlantic Records, Interscope ===\nBay-Schuck returned to Los Angeles following his college graduation. Knowing that jobs at record companies had become scarce as the music industry constricted in the post-Napster era, he registered at an employment agency that placed temps at labels. He was assigned a short-term job at Interscope, and was quickly hired as a full-time assistant to Martin Kierszenbaum, then the head of international marketing for the label.  Determined to work in A&R, he left Interscope a year later to take a job as an A&R assistant at Atlantic.  In 2006, he was promoted to a staff A&R position.  His first hits in an A&R capacity were with the songs \"Shawty\" by Plies featuring T-Pain, and \"Right Round\" by Flo Rida featuring Kesha. Bay-Schuck co-wrote \"Right Round,\" which went five times platinum in the US and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\nOver the course of his ten years at Atlantic, Bay-Schuck worked with Cee Lo Green, B.o.B., T.I., Trey Songz, Travie McCoy, and Trick Daddy, among others. Most notably, he discovered, signed and developed Bruno Mars, who has since sold more than 170 million singles and 26 million albums worldwide. Following his success with Mars, Bay-Schuck, who had originally focused on rap and R&B, worked with artists of all genres. He was appointed senior vice president of A&R for Atlantic in 2012.\nIn 2014, Bay-Schuck was named president of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA). At IGA he worked with artists including Gwen Stefani, Imagine Dragons, Lady Gaga, Skylar Grey, Maroon 5, OneRepublic, and Selena Gomez.\n\n\n=== Warner Records ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Bay-Schuck had been appointed CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records. He assumed the position in October 2018. He said that increasing the focus on pop and hip hop artists were among his goals as Warner's CEO; since then, the label has had #1 hits with Saweetie featuring Doja Cat (\"Best Friend\"), Dua Lipa (\"Levitating\") and Bebe Rexha (\"Meant to Be\"); and signed artists including Zach Bryan, Teddy Swims, NLE Choppa, Benson Boone, Veeze, and Omar Apollo.\nBay-Schuck was an executive producer of the 2021 documentary Tom Petty, Somewhere You Feel Free: The Making of Wildflowers. The film won a Producers Guild Award in 2022.   He was included in the Billboard Power 100  in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. He appeared on the Billboard Country Power Players list in 2024. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWarner Records\nATCO Records is an American record label founded in 1955. It is owned by Warner Music Group and operates as an imprint of Atlantic Records. After several decades of dormancy and infrequent activity under alternating Warner Music labels, the company was relaunched by Atlantic Records in early 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s–1960s: Beginnings ===\nATCO Records was devised as an outlet for productions by one of Atlantic Records' founders, Herb Abramson, who had returned to the company from military service. The label was also intended as a home for acts that did not fit the format of the main Atlantic brand, which was releasing blues, jazz, rhythm and blues and soul. The planned name for the label was Atlas.  But it was changed to ATCO when it was discovered there was already an Atlas Records. The ATCO name is an abbreviation of ATlantic COrporation. ATCO also provided distribution for other labels, including RSO, Volt, Island, Modern, Ruthless, Hansa, and Rolling Stones. For most of its history, ATCO was known for pop and rock music, but during its early years, it produced some jazz albums. These included Harry Arnold, Betty Carter, King Curtis, Herb Geller, Roland Hanna, and Helen Merrill.\nATCO's rock era began with Bobby Darin and The Coasters. In the early 1960s, Atlantic began to license material from international sources, leading to instrumental hit singles from Jorgen Ingmann, Acker Bilk and Bent Fabric. Starting in the mid-1960s, ATCO moved into rock-and-roll with Sonny and Cher, Buffalo Springfield, Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly and Cream (the latter under license from British label Polydor).\nIn 1964, ATCO released a single in the US by the Beatles, \"Ain't She Sweet\" (flip side \"Nobody's Child\", with lead singer Tony Sheridan), which had been recorded in Hamburg in 1961. With lead vocals by John Lennon, \"Ain't She Sweet\" reached No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in August 1964. ATCO also released an album entitled Ain't She Sweet which featured the other two tracks by Sheridan and The Beatles from the Hamburg session and filled out by eight other songs covered by The Swallows.\nIn 1966, ATCO released \"Substitute\" by the Who. The song was issued through an arrangement with UK Polydor Records because of the dispute The Who was having with their producer, Shel Talmy, and their contract with US Decca Records and UK Brunswick Records. This would be the only Who recording to appear on ATCO, although Pete Townshend and John Entwistle would eventually sign to ATCO as solo artists, and Roger Daltrey later signed a US solo deal with Atlantic. This release differs from the UK release with a different structure/edit (the break comes in after the first verse vs. second), a substitute lyric (\"I try walking forward but my feet walk back\" in place of \"I look all white but my dad was black\").\n\n\n=== 1970s–1980s: Downsizing ===\nDuring the 1970s, Atlantic Records began to broaden the range of its own roster, causing ATCO to become deemphasized as many of its acts would eventually have their material released under the main Atlantic brand. In the middle 1970s, ATCO became increasingly used for hard rock acts and some British and European bands. During this time, the label issued early albums from AC/DC. Starting in 1978, however, AC/DC releases were issued on Atlantic until their contract with the label ended in the 1990s. In 1980, ATCO's visibility rose with strong chart performances from Pete Townshend's Empty Glass album and the song \"Cars\" by Gary Numan. As the 1980s wore on, ATCO continued to have streamlined success with artists such as Sweet Sensation, JJ Fad and Michel'le (the latter who were signed to the label in conjunction with Ruthless Records), while steadily becoming less active overall.\n\n\n=== 1990s: Merger with EastWest Records America and dormancy ===\nThe last number one hit on ATCO was \"If Wishes Came True\" by Sweet Sensation in 1990. The following year, Atlantic Records Senior VP Sylvia Rhone orchestrated the merger o\nAmerican singer-songwriter Bruno Mars has recorded songs for three studio albums, one collaborative album, one extended play (EP) and three soundtrack albums. He has also featured as a guest artist and provided background vocals to other songs. After an unsuccessful contract with Motown Records and a fruitless conversation with will.i.am's management, Mars signed with Atlantic Records in 2009. He came to prominence as a composer for other artists with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, who called themselves the Smeezingtons. They composed B.o.B's \"Nothin' on You\" (2009), and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\" (2010); Mars sang on their choruses.\nThe Smeezingtons composed Mars's debut EP, It's Better If You Don't Understand, released in May 2010, and his debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, released in October 2010. The album included the songs \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\" and \"Runaway Baby\". It featured collaborations with Damian Marley, B.o.B and CeeLo Green, and the songs included on the EP, \"Somewhere in Brooklyn\", \"The Other Side\", \"Count On Me\" and \"Talking to the Moon\". Mars's love for doo-wop music inspired the album which is primarily a pop, reggae pop and R&B record. In 2011, he appeared as a featured artist on Bad Meets Evil's \"Lighters\" and Lil Wayne's \"Mirror\". He has contributed songs to soundtracks: \"It Will Rain\" for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, \"Young, Wild & Free\" by Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa for Mac & Devin Go to High School and \"Welcome Back\" for Rio 2.\nMars's second studio album Unorthodox Jukebox, released in December 2012, included the tracks \"Locked Out of Heaven\", \"When I Was Your Man\", \"Treasure\" and \"Moonshine\". The Smeezingtons collaborated with other producers, including Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, to create a disco, funk, pop, reggae, and rock album. Lyrically, it showcases traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. In 2014, Ronson's single, \"Uptown Funk\", featured Mars. Shampoo Press & Curl, a production trio formed by Mars, Lawrence and Christopher Brody Brown, composed the tracks on his third studio album, 24K Magic, released in November 2016. It included the songs \"24K Magic\", \"That's What I Like\", and a remix of \"Finesse\" featuring Cardi B. Funk, pop and R&B influenced the creation of this album, which involves subjects of money and sex.\nMars and Anderson .Paak, as Silk Sonic, released the collaborative studio album An Evening with Silk Sonic, in November 2021. It was produced by Mars, D'Mile and The Stereotypes. It includes the singles \"Leave the Door Open\" and \"Smokin out the Window\". The album is rooted in R&B, soul, funk, early hip-hop and pop. It explores themes of \"seduction, romance\", reconciliation and materialism. In 2024, Mars collaborated with Lady Gaga on the single \"Die With a Smile\" and with Rosé on Apt.. \n\n\n== Songs ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBruno Mars on AllMusic\nAsylum Records is an American record label, founded in 1971 by David Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts. It was taken over by Warner Communications (now the Warner Music Group) in 1972, and later merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records.\nAfter previous incarnations, it is geared primarily towards hip-hop, along with rock and alternative metal. It is owned and distributed by Warner Music Group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nAsylum was founded in 1971 by David Geffen, and partner Elliot Roberts, both of whom had previously worked as agents at the William Morris Agency, and operated a folk/rock label. They had also previously founded their own management company. While unsuccessfully pitching a recording contract for their client Jackson Browne to Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun, Geffen said, \"You'll make a lot of money.\" Ertegun replied, \"You know what, David, I have a lot of money. Why don't you start a record company and then you'll have a lot of money.\" A deal was then struck in which Ertegun would put up the initial funds, Atlantic Records would distribute Asylum Records, and the profits would be split 50/50.\nAlthough they knew they would sign Browne, the first act that Geffen asked to join the label was his close friend Laura Nyro, whose career he was managing at the time. Nyro initially agreed, but without Geffen's knowledge she changed her mind and re-signed with Columbia Records. Geffen said it was the biggest betrayal of his life up to that point and that he \"cried for days\".\nAsylum's early releases were distributed by Atlantic Records. The same year, Asylum signed Jo Jo Gunne, Linda Ronstadt, John David Souther, Judee Sill, David Blue, Joni Mitchell and Glenn Frey (whom Geffen encouraged to form the Eagles, with Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner). In 1972, then folk-based singer/songwriter Tom Waits signed with the label, releasing his debut, Closing Time, in 1973. His seventh and final album for the label, Heartattack and Vine, was released in 1980. Former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty signed with the label in 1974. The biggest coup for Asylum was signing Bob Dylan, who had been with Columbia Records since the early 1960s but who, after a falling-out with the company, was shopping around for a new label. Dylan recorded two albums, Planet Waves and the live Before the Flood, for Asylum before returning to Columbia. Columbia reissued Dylan's two Asylum albums in 1981.\n\n\n=== Merger with Elektra Records ===\n \n\nAsylum was taken over by Warner Communications in 1973 and merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records. David Geffen and Elliot Roberts each received $2 million in cash and $5 million in Warner Communications stock, thereby becoming two of the company's largest shareholders. Geffen served as president and chairman of Elektra/Asylum Records until 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named vice-chairman of Warner Bros. One of Asylum's most prominent signings after Geffen's departure was Warren Zevon, who released a series of successful and critically acclaimed LPs for the label; his self-titled 1976 label debut has been called the best California rock album of the decade.\nBy the early 1980s, although the copyright lines on albums still read \"Elektra/Asylum Records\" or \"Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch Records\", Elektra was becoming the more prominent of the two labels with Asylum turning into a secondary imprint. By the middle of the decade, the company was unofficially calling itself Elektra Records, and in 1989 it was renamed Elektra Entertainment. By this time Asylum's remaining acts had been shifted to the Elektra roster, although catalog recordings and reissues continued to be sold with the Asylum label on them.\n\n\n=== Country format ===\nAsylum was reformatted into a country music label, still operated by Elektra, in 1992. Under the new format, Asylum scored successful recordings by such acts as Emmylou Harris, Brother Phelps, Thrashe\nJohn Ford Coley (born October 13, 1948) is an American singer, classically trained pianist, guitarist, actor, and author most known for his partnership in the musical duo England Dan & John Ford Coley.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nColey was born John Edward Colley in Dallas, Texas, United States. He grew up listening to the Grand Ole Opry, early rock and roll, singing church hymns and was trained as a classical pianist. At 16, while at W. W. Samuell High School in Dallas, Coley, along with schoolmate Dan Seals, joined the group Theze Few, which later became Southwest F.O.B. and toured the Texas music scene where they had one hit, \"The Smell of Incense\", which in 1969 rose to number 43 on the charts. This band played on the bill with Led Zeppelin and other acts.\nWhile in the band, Seals and Coley began their own acoustic act, Coley and Wayland. The act was renamed England Dan & John Ford Coley, and the duo was signed by A&M Records. In 1971, the two moved to Los Angeles where they opened for numerous bands. Their first break came in 1972 with the song \"Simone\". It became a number one hit in Japan and was popular in France. However, \"Simone\" did not fare as well in the United States, and the two were released from their contract with A&M after three albums.\n\n\n== Signing to Atlantic Records ==\nTwo years later, they acquired another record deal from Atlantic Records subsidiary Big Tree Records and released the song \"I'd Really Love to See You Tonight\". Overall they had four top-ten hits and two top-twenty hits. They were nominated for a Grammy Award, received triple-platinum and gold records and released eight albums; additionally, other recordings were released abroad.\nThe duo disbanded in 1980.\n\n\n== After the 1980s ==\nColey formed another group that released an album on A&M Records: Leslie, Kelly and John Ford Coley (featuring sisters Leslie and Kelly Bulkin). He acted in teen films in the 1980s, acquired a small ranch in the 1990s, and wrote songs for film and television. He returned to touring in 1996. Coley plays with groups and artists including Ambrosia and Terry Sylvester (formerly of The Hollies), Three Dog Night, Lou Gramm (of Foreigner), Christopher Cross, Poco, Stephen Bishop, Al Stewart, Edgar Winter and others.\nIn 1996, Coley made a trip south for Tin Pan South and began making trips to Nashville to be part of the music community. He moved his family and horses across country to Tennessee in 1999. While in Tennessee, Coley, once a Baháʼí, converted back to Christianity. Coley continues to perform internationally.\nOn August 11, 1997, a handyman in Long Island, New York was arrested for impersonating Coley.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSmell of Incense - Southwest F.O.B., 1969\nEngland Dan and John Ford Coley - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1971\nFables - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1972\nI Hear Music - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1976\nNights Are Forever - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1976\nDowdy Ferry Road - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1977\nSome Things Don't Come Easy - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1978\nDr. Heckle and Mr. Jive - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1979\nJust Tell Me You Love Me - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1980\nLeslie, Kelly and John Ford Coley - Leslie, Kelly and John Ford Coley, 1980 (A&M Records)\nThe Best of England Dan and John Ford Coley - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1980\nLive from the Philippines - John Ford Coley, 2009\nEclectic - John Ford Coley, 2016\nLong Way Home (Live in Israel & L.A.) - John Ford Coley, 2020\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe following is a list of songs known to have been recorded by Australian rock band AC/DC. Since 1973, they have released 18 studio albums (16 available worldwide and two issued only in Australasia), two soundtrack albums, three live albums, one extended play, 57 singles, 11 video albums, 52 music videos and two box sets. Although many AC/DC singles have been released, the band refused to issue any greatest hits-type packages. Brothers Angus (lead guitar) and Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar) formed AC/DC in November 1973 in Sydney. The band released two albums in Australasia before issuing their first international effort, High Voltage in 1976; the Youngs had been joined by vocalist Bon Scott, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. In 1980, less than a year after the appearance of the successful Highway to Hell, Scott died and was replaced by British singer Brian Johnson, with whom AC/DC released their best-selling album, Back in Black. The album Black Ice, from 2008, reached number one in 29 countries. In 50 years of their career, AC/DC have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, roughly 100 million in the United States. Back in Black alone sold 25 million copies in the US (50 million worldwide), and went on to become the second highest-selling album in history.\nVerizon made AC/DC albums available for digital download in 2007; for five years the band refused to release their albums via iTunes, as that company allows downloading of individual tracks. Angus Young observed, \"We honestly believe the songs on any of our albums belong together. If we were on iTunes, we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album – and we don't think that represents us musically.\" However, in November 2012, the band relented and released their entire discography via iTunes. On 30 June 2015 their catalogue appeared on Spotify for the first time, which made their works available for streaming. Their most certified singles in the US are \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" and \"Back in Black\" (both 1980) – each have received 3× platinum from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2019. In Australia, \"Thunderstruck\" (1990) was accredited 10× platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in 2022.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nInterscope Records is an American record label based in Santa Monica, California, owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&M imprint. Founded in late 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $20 million joint venture with Atlantic Records of Warner Music Group and Interscope Communications, it differed from most record labels by letting A&R staff control decisions and allowing artists and producers full creative control. Interscope's first hit records arrived in under a year, and it achieved profitability in 1993. Chair and CEO until May 2014, Iovine was succeeded by John Janick.\nIn 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from hardcore hip hop label Death Row Records, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, then the parent of Warner Music Group, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115 million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $200 million by MCA Inc., later known as Universal Music Group.\nInterscope's artist roster includes Sting, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Lady Gaga, OneRepublic, Dermot Kennedy, Blackpink, Dr. Dre, DaBaby, Billie Eilish, Imagine Dragons, Olivia Rodrigo, Selena Gomez, Camila Cabello, Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Jennifer Hudson, Ken Carson, Destroy Lonely, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, Lana Del Rey, Maroon 5, Moneybagg Yo, Gwen Stefani, Rae Sremmurd, Finneas, Gracie Abrams,  Zedd, Machine Gun Kelly, U2, Yeat, Yungblud, Cuco, d4vd, Homixide Gang, Reneé Rapp, J. Cole and Karol G.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1990–1995: Origins, early success, and joint ventures ===\nIn mid 1990, Ted Field began to build Interscope Records as a division of his film company, Interscope Communications. To run it, he hired John McClain, who had played a central role in Janet Jackson's success at A&M Records, and Tom Whalley, who had been the head of A&R at Capitol Records. Separately, Iovine, who had produced records for U2, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks, and John Lennon, among others, was trying to raise money to start a label. \"I thought, 'Music is going to change,'\" Iovine said in 1997. \"'Young bands aren't going to be asking for me.' But I love working with the new thing. I always liked the part of the business that's the first time you hear something, and I knew I wasn't in that business anymore.\"\nIovine and Field were introduced by Paul McGuinness, then U2's manager.  After a series of negotiations led by David Geffen, they came to an agreement, and in 1990, Interscope Records was founded as a joint venture with Atlantic Records. In a 1997 article in Rolling Stone, David Wild wrote: \"Interscope's start-up coincided with a period of incredible change in the music world. Nirvana had ushered in the alternative revolution... While the major labels were packed with rosters full of expensive veteran artists who had to redefine themselves for a new rock era, Interscope was in the business of signing new artists and could – as Iovine puts it – 'move on a dime.'\"\nBased in Los Angeles, California in the Westwood neighborhood at an office building on 10900 Wilshire Boulevard, Interscope was run by \"music men\". It was a departure from the music industry practices of the 1970s and 1980s, when labels traditionally appointed lawyers and promotion executives to senior positions.  A founding tenet of the label was that artists would have complete creative control.\nInterscope's first release was \"Rico Suave\" by Ecuadorian rapper Gerardo in December 1990; the single reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in April 1991. Primus' Interscope debut, Sailing the Seas of Cheese, was released in May, followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's Music for the People in July.  It included the number-one single \"Good Vibrations\". Two days after first hearing his demo, Whalley signed Tupac Shakur in August 1991, and by November, Intersc\nRolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. On 1 April 1971, the band signed a distribution deal for five albums with Ahmet Ertegun, acting on behalf of Atlantic Records. In the US, the albums were distributed by Atlantic until 1984. In the UK, Rolling Stones Records were distributed by WEA from 1971 to 1977 and by EMI from 1978 to 1984. In 1986, Columbia Records started distributing it in the United States and CBS for the rest of the world until 1991. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue and lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn its original concept, the label was formed to ensure the Rolling Stones would retain the rights over their own music, while also giving each bandmember the option to release solo albums. The first album to be released was Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka in 1971, which is widely credited with being the first world music LP. In 1972 the label released Jamming with Edward!, a collection of tracks recorded by Jagger, Wyman, and Watts with Nicky Hopkins and Ry Cooder in 1969.\nBill Wyman released two solo albums through the label, Monkey Grip in 1974 and Stone Alone in 1976. Wyman found that the label's promotional and sales people paid very little attention to him, as the Rolling Stones had albums due out shortly after both releases which were the subject of major marketing campaigns. As a result, Wyman chose to record his next solo album with A&M.\nThe label also released a solo single by Richards in December 1978, featuring a rendition of Chuck Berry's \"Run Rudolph Run\" backed by a version of Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\".\n\n\n== Other artists ==\nUnlike Apple Records, Grunt Records, Purple Records, or Swan Song Records (the vanity labels of the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin respectively), Rolling Stones Records never made much of an effort to sign outside artists. Kracker, a Cuban American rock group produced by Rolling Stones producer, Jimmy Miller, was the first outside act to be signed to Rolling Stones Records in 1973. Kracker, along with Billy Preston, opened the show for the Stones during their 1973 European Tour. John Phillips was signed to Rolling Stones Records in 1976.\n\n\n=== Peter Tosh ===\nIn 1977 Peter Tosh, a former member of Bob Marley's band the Wailers signed a recording deal with Rolling Stones Records. His debut album on the label, Bush Doctor, which featured Jagger on the track \"Don't Look Back\", was moderately successful. Despite further moderate success, Tosh left the label in 1981 due to personal problems with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, his band members and the recent passing of Bob Marley.\n\n\n== 1980s to the end ==\nJagger released his first solo albums, She's the Boss and Primitive Cool, in 1985 and 1987 respectively, through a newly conceived partnership between Rolling Stones Records and CBS Records (now Sony Music). Thus the trademark Rolling Stones logo was affixed to each record and the label \"Rolling Stones Records\" was also printed on each new release, which angered Richards. In fact, through the 1980s and early 1990s, \"Rolling Stones Records\" continued to be printed on the labels of all new releases up through Flashpoint (1991). However, as the back catalogue has been shifted to Virgin/EMI, these markers are the last vapour trails of Rolling Stones Records. In 2008, the group switched distribution of Rolling Stones Records back catalogue material as well as new material to Polydor Records in the UK, and Interscope Records in the US (both imprints of Universal Music Group, also\nAtlantic Crossing is the sixth solo album by Rod Stewart. Released on 15 August 1975, and recorded in five American studios including Muscle Shoals, Alabama, between April and June 1975, it was produced by Tom Dowd, and peaked at number one in the UK (his fourth solo album to do so), and number nine on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. During 1975 Stewart moved to  Los Angeles, switched record labels to Warner Brothers, and ended his association with Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan and the stable of musicians who had been his core collaborators on his albums for Mercury Records.\nThe album was divided into a fast side and a slow side, apparently at the suggestion of Stewart's then-girlfriend, Swedish actress Britt Ekland. Stewart would repeat the format for his next two albums. The album contained two of Stewart's most popular songs, \"Sailing\" and \"I Don't Want to Talk About It”, and classic rock favourites \"Three Time Loser\" and \"Stone Cold Sober\". The album was the 14th of Stewart's career, starting with Jeff Beck's Truth in 1968, and his sixth solo.  \n\n\n== Recording ==\n\nThe album was recorded in five different American studios: A&R (New York), Criteria (Miami), Wally Heider's Studio 3 (Hollywood), Hi Recording Studio (Memphis), and Muscle Shoals (Alabama) between April and June 1975, and produced by Tom Dowd, who had been the engineer or producer for many of Stewart's heroes during Dowd's time at Atlantic Records. \nWith Atlantic Crossing, Stewart ended his association with Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan and the stable of musicians who had been his core collaborators on his classic run of albums for Mercury Records, fusing soul and folk. Instead, he used a group of session musicians, including The Memphis Horns and Booker T. and the MG's. The only song performed from this album on The Faces' final US tour in autumn 1975 was \"Three Time Loser\", and the rest of the group heavily disliked Stewart's change in musical direction on this album. Following the success of the album, and his move to the U.S., Stewart announced his exit from the Faces by the end of the year.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\"Sailing\" was a number one hit in the UK in September 1975, and returned to the UK Top 3 a year later when it was used as the theme for the BBC series Sailor; both acoustic and electric guitars in the song were played by Pete Carr. In 1977, almost two years after the album was released, Stewart scored another UK number one from the album with the double A-side single \"I Don't Want to Talk About It\" and \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" (from the album A Night on the Town - 1976).\nIn 2009, Rhino Records released a two-disc version of the album with bonus tracks.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nFast Side (Side One)\n\n\"Three Time Loser\" (Rod Stewart) – 4:03\n\"Alright for an Hour\" (Stewart, Jesse Ed Davis) – 4:17\n\"All in the Name of Rock 'N' Roll\" (Stewart) – 5:02\n\"Drift Away\" (Mentor Williams) – 3:43\n\"Stone Cold Sober\" (Stewart, Steve Cropper) – 4:12\nSlow Side (Side Two)\n\n\"I Don't Want to Talk About It\" (Danny Whitten) – 4:47\n\"It's Not the Spotlight\" (Barry Goldberg, Gerry Goffin) – 4:21\n\"This Old Heart of Mine\" (Lamont Dozier, Brian Holland, Eddie Holland, Sylvia Moy) – 4:04\n\"Still Love You\" (Stewart) – 5:08\n\"Sailing\" (Gavin Sutherland) – 4:37\n\n\n=== 2009 two disc re-release ===\nDisc one\n\nTrack 1 – 10 features the original album.\n\"Skye Boat Song (The Atlantic Crossing Drum & Pipe Band)\" (Harold Boulton, Annie MacLeod) 4:13\nDisc two\n\n\"To Love Somebody\" (with Booker T. & The MG's) (Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb) – 4:12\n\"Holy Cow\" (with Booker T. & The MG's) (Allen Toussaint) – 3:16\n\"Return to Sender\" (with Booker T. & The MG's) (Otis Blackwell, Scott Winfield) – 3:42\n\"Three Time Loser\" [Alternate Version] (Stewart) – 4:40\n\"Alright for an Hour\" [Alternate Version] (Stewart, Davis) – 4:36\n\"All in the Name of Rock 'n' Roll\" [Alternate Version] (Stewart) – 5:00\n\"Drift Away\" [Alternate Version] (Williams) – 3:58\n\"Too Much Noise\" [Early Version of \"Stone Cold Sober\"] (Stewart,\nThe Staves are an English indie folk duo of sisters Jessica and Camilla Staveley-Taylor from Watford, Hertfordshire, England. Formerly their third sister Emily was also part of the band. \n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Staves began performing together at open-mic nights in Watford hosted by a local pub, The Horns. Originally performing as The Staveley-Taylors, the trio later changed their name to The Staves.\nThe group appeared on the Tom Jones album Praise and Blame, released in July 2010. They supported Mt. Desolation on their UK tour in late 2010. Jessica Staveley-Taylor also performed as part of Mt. Desolation and provided vocals for their eponymous album. The Staves released the Live at Cecil Sharp House EP and the Mexico EP in 2011, and appeared on Fionn Regan's third studio album, 100 Acres of Sycamore.\nThe Staves toured in the United States while supporting The Civil Wars in January 2012. They followed these appearances with performances at South by Southwest and a tour in March and April with Bear's Den, Nathaniel Rateliff and Ben Howard. This tour was the subject of the film, Austin to Boston, a documentary by Marcus Haney. The band supported Bon Iver on their May and June 2012 US and Canadian tour.\nThe band's debut album, Dead & Born & Grown, was released in November 2012 and produced by Glyn Johns and Ethan Johns.\nAn excerpt from their performance of \"Facing West\" on Later... with Jools Holland was featured on the This is BBC Two promotional programme.\nThe second album, If I Was, was released 23 March 2015 on Atlantic Records in the UK/EU and on 31 March on Nonesuch Records in the US; the record was produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. The album debuted at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart. In July 2015, the Staves performed with Bon Iver as guest artists along with Colin Stetson, yMusic, and No BS! Brass for Bon Iver's return to the stage as part of the Eaux Claires Festival in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. They have also performed as the warm-up act for Florence and the Machine on Florence's How Big Tour supporting How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful.\nThe Staves joined the live line-up of Bon Iver for the latter's Asia tour in late February and early March 2016.\nOn 24 November 2017, The Staves released The Way is Read − an album created in conjunction with the New York-based chamber music ensemble yMusic. This album is available on vinyl, via the streaming service TIDAL in both normal and high quality MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) formats, and as an MP3 download. There is no CD version available.\nIn October and November 2018, they supported First Aid Kit on their Rebel Heart tour.\nIn January 2020, the Staves announced that Emily Staveley-Taylor would not take part in touring, following the birth of her daughter.\nIn March 2020, the Staves announced they would be performing at the Glastonbury Festival in 2020. But due to concerns over the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, the festival had to be cancelled.\nOn 5 February 2021, their third studio album Good Woman was released via Atlantic Records UK and Nonesuch Records. The album was produced by John Congleton and charted at number 13 in the UK Albums Chart.\nIn November 2023, the Staves announced their fifth LP, All Now, and released the title track, having previously shared another song from the record, \"You Held It All\". The album will be their first as a two-piece, after the departure of Emily Staveley-Taylor.\n\n\n== Personal lives ==\nThe sisters learned to play guitar from their father while growing up in Watford. As children, they aspired to create a sketch comedy television programme together. They enjoy Guinness and are vocal in challenging tropes about sensitive wilderness-bound artists that dominate modern folk music culture.\nIn addition to touring with Bon Iver and producing If I Was with Justin Vernon, the sisters have become friends with the Wisconsin-born musician.\nIn mid 2018, the sisters' mother, Jean, a former teacher who had encouraged them to follow their dream of making \nLed Zeppelin were an English rock band who recorded 94 songs between 1968 and 1980. The band pioneered the concept of album-oriented rock and often refused to release popular songs as singles, instead viewing their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, and disliked record labels re-editing their songs for single releases.\nTheir self-titled debut album, Led Zeppelin, released in early 1969, contained songs that were influenced by the genres of blues, hard rock and heavy metal. Led Zeppelin II, released in October 1969, built upon their debut with a more direct, hard-hitting sound that has become a blueprint for heavy metal bands. Led Zeppelin III (1970) marked a musical growth for the band; half of its songs were hard rockers while the other half were built upon folk and acoustic music that gave it \"extra depth\". \"Immigrant Song\", released as a single, was backed by the band's only non-album single, \"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, was released in November 1971. Bringing together all the genres from their previous albums, the album contains some of the band's best-known songs, including \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Going to California\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", referred to as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.\nThe band's following albums, Houses of the Holy (1973) and Physical Graffiti (1975), continued the band's musical growth. Houses of the Holy contained a wider range of musical styles, from the ballad \"The Rain Song\" to the funk-inspired \"The Crunge\", while Physical Graffiti was a double album that contained new songs as well as unreleased outtakes from previous albums. The album, like its predecessor, contained a variety of musical styles, including hard rock, funk, acoustic rock, blues, soft and progressive rock, and even country rock. Presence (1976) marked a departure from their previous albums by featuring more straightforward, guitar-driven songs with less emphasis on musical experimentation. In Through the Out Door (1979), a direct contrast to Presence, featured a keyboard-heavy sound that was dominated by Jones. The album would prove to be their last as a band, as after Bonham's death in September 1980, the remaining members decided to disband the group. Coda (1982) is a collection of outtakes from various sessions during the band's career.\nSince their breakup, 26 songs have seen official release. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set (1990) saw the release of the band's cover of Robert Johnson's \"Travelling Riverside Blues\", the live medley \"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\", and the first album release of \"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do?\"; the second boxed set (1993) saw the release of \"Baby Come On Home\". New songs were also released on BBC Sessions (1997) and its remaster, The Complete BBC Sessions (2015), 2003's Led Zeppelin DVD and the live album How the West Was Won (2003). After the release of the concert film Celebration Day (2012), Page announced the remastering of the band's discography in the form of deluxe editions, which together included 13 previously unreleased songs, some of which were different mixes of previously released songs. The albums were released between 2014 and 2015.\n\n\n== Songs ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAkkerman, Gregg (2014).

Its position was greatly improved by its distribution deal with Stax. In 1967, Atlantic became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Led Zeppelin, and Yes.\nIn 2004, Atlantic and its sister label Elektra were merged into the Atlantic Records Group.

Abramson's wife Miriam ran the label's publishing company, Progressive Music, and did most office duties until 1949 when Atlantic hired its first employee, bookkeeper Francine Wakschal, who remained with the label for the next 49 years. Miriam gained a reputation for toughness. Staff engineer Tom Dowd recalled, \"Tokyo Rose was the kindest name some people had for her\" and Doc Pomus described her as \"an extraordinarily vitriolic woman\". When interviewed in 2009, she attributed her reputation to the company's chronic cash-flow shortage: \"... most of the problems we had with artists were that they wanted advances, and that was very difficult for us ... we were undercapitalized for a long time.\" The label's office in the Ritz Hotel in Manhattan proved too expensive, so they moved to a room in the Hotel Jefferson.

In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: Roadrunner Records, Fueled by Ramen, Custard Records and Maybach Music Group. Elektra was reactivated as a brand of Atlantic Records Group in 2009.

Instead, he used a group of session musicians, including The Memphis Horns and Booker T. and the MG's. The only song performed from this album on The Faces' final US tour in autumn 1975 was \"Three Time Loser\", and the rest of the group heavily disliked Stewart's change in musical direction on this album. Following the success of the album, and his move to the U.S., Stewart announced his exit from the Faces by the end of the year."

Led Zeppelin III (1970) marked a musical growth for the band; half of its songs were hard rockers while the other half were built upon folk and acoustic music that gave it \"extra depth\". \"Immigrant Song\", released as a single, was backed by the band's only non-album single, \"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, was released in November 1971.
