His distinctions are his booming voice presence, \"motivational\" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases.

Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016\\), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the *Billboard* 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nHis tenth album, *Grateful* (2017\\), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and \"Wild Thoughts\" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the *Billboard* Hot 100, respectively.
