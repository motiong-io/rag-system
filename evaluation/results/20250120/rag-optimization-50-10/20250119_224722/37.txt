Generated answer: That's an interesting connection. Unfortunately, I don't have information on when the Mercedes-Benz W222 arrived at dealerships, as my previous observations mentioned. However, I can try to help you with the second part of the question.

If you provide me with the date when the Mercedes-Benz W222 arrived at dealerships, I can try to find out which star of the sit-com Modern Family got married on that day and who they married. Alternatively, if you give me a hint about which star from Modern Family you are thinking of, I can try to find the information about their wedding.
