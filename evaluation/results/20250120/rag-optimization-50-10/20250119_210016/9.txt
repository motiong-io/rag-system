        obersevations:
        Who is the Pope born Pietro Barbo?:
The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He was born on February 23, 1417, in Venice, and served as the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 1464 until his death in 1471.

What long-running war did Pope Paul II end two years after his papacy began?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order. Pope Paul II helped to negotiate the Second Peace of Thorn, which was signed on October 10, 1466, ending the war. This occurred two years after his papacy began in 1464.

What famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry, took place 400 years earlier than the end of the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order ended in 1466. 

400 years earlier than that would be 1266. 

The famous conflict that took place around that time and was immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry was the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, not 1266. However, another conflict that occurred in 1266 and was related to the Norman Conquest was the Second Barons' War.


        


Generated answer: The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He ended the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order two years after his papacy began. 

The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466. If we go back 400 years from that, we get to 1266. However, a famous conflict immortalized in tapestry that took place around that time is not exactly from 1266, but rather from 1066, which is the Norman Conquest of England, as depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. 

So, while not exactly 400 years earlier, the Norman Conquest of England, immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry, is a famous conflict that took place roughly around that time period.
