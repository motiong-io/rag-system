Generated answer: To find the total population of the cities in Oklahoma that had at least 100,000 residents according to the 2020 United States census, we need to look at the populations of Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman, and Broken Arrow in the 1990 United States census.

The populations were:
1. **Oklahoma City**: 444,719
2. **Tulsa**: 367,302
3. **Norman**: Around 78,000
4. **Broken Arrow**: 58,043

Now we add these numbers together:
444,719 + 367,302 + 78,000 + 58,043 = 948,064

So the total population of these cities in Oklahoma according to the 1990 United States census was approximately 948,064.
