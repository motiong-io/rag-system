Generated answer: Based on the information you provided, I believe the Ancient Roman City you are thinking of is either Pompeii or Herculaneum. 

Both cities were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano, in 79 AD. 

As for your question about the session where it was decided that the city would be named a UNESCO world heritage site, I found that Pompeii and Herculaneum, along with Torre Annunziata, were designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1980. The session where this decision was made was likely held during the 4th session of the World Heritage Committee in Paris, France.
