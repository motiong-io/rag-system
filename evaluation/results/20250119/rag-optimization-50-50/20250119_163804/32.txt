Question: As of 2010, if you added the number of times Brazil had won the World Cup to the amount of times the Chicago Bulls had won the NBA Championship and multiplied this number by the amount of times the Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl, what number are you left with?
Ground truth: 55
log:

Generated answer: As of 2010, Brazil had won the World Cup 5 times. The Chicago Bulls had won the NBA Championship 6 times. The Dallas Cowboys had won the Super Bowl 5 times.

So, if we add the number of World Cup wins to the number of NBA Championships: 5 + 6 = 11

Then, we multiply this result by the number of Super Bowl wins: 11 * 5 = 55

The answer is 55.

Check result: Y
