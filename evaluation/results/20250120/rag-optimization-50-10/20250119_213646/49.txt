        obersevations:
        Which U.S. president won Alaska?:
Alaska was purchased from Russia by the United States in 1867, during the presidency of Andrew Johnson. The purchase was negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, and it is often referred to as "Seward's Folly." However, it was President Andrew Johnson who signed the treaty authorizing the purchase on March 30, 1867.

It's worth noting that Alaska was not won in a military conflict or election, but rather it was purchased from Russia for $7.2 million, which is approximately $125 million in today's dollars.

Who is the U.S. president that graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael?:
The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald R. Ford. According to the provided text, Gerald Ford attended Yale Law School and had four children, including Michael, Jack, Steven, and Susan.

What is the middle name of Andrew Johnson?:

Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to combine the information from the given observations.

The U.S. president who "won" Alaska is Andrew Johnson, as he signed the treaty authorizing the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.

The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald R. Ford.

Since these are two different presidents, we need to find a common link between them. However, there isn't one. Andrew Johnson and Gerald R. Ford are two separate individuals with different backgrounds and characteristics.

But to answer your question directly: 
Andrew Johnson doesn't have a middle name.
Gerald R. Ford's middle name is Rudolph.

So as of 2024, at the time of his birth, Gerald R. Ford's middle name was Rudolph, but he didn't win Alaska. Andrew Johnson won Alaska but doesn't have a middle name.
