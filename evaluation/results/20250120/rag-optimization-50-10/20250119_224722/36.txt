Generated answer: To answer this question, I need to make some connections between the information provided. 

First, I need to find out who the person is that the longest river in British Columbia is named after. After some research, I found that the longest river in British Columbia that only flows within the province is the Fraser River, and it is named after Simon Fraser.

Simon Fraser was born in 1776. 

Next, I need to calculate how old Harvard University was when Simon Fraser was born. Harvard University was founded in 1636, so when Simon Fraser was born in 1776, Harvard University was 140 years old.

Therefore, Harvard University was 140 years old when Simon Fraser, the person after whom the longest river in British Columbia is named, was born.
