Generated answer: Based on the information you provided, I believe the Ancient Roman City you are thinking of is either Pompeii or Herculaneum. 

Both cities were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano, in 79 AD. 

As for your question, Pompeii and Herculaneum were both designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1980. The session where this decision was made was held in Sydney, Australia, but more specifically, it was at the 4th session of the World Heritage Committee, which took place from September 22 to October 1, 1980, but I couldn't find information on the exact location within Sydney where the session was held.
