Generated answer: The text doesn't specifically mention the number Tommy Lawton wore during his time at Chelsea FC. However, it does provide some general information about squad numbers during that era.

In the 1940s, when Lawton played for Chelsea, squad numbers were not yet standardized, and players often wore different numbers in different games. However, it's likely that Lawton would have worn a number between 1 and 11, as these were the traditional numbers assigned to outfield players during that time.

If I had to make an educated guess, I'd say Lawton might have worn the number 9 shirt, which is often associated with center-forwards. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to say for certain what number he would have worn.

Check result: Y
