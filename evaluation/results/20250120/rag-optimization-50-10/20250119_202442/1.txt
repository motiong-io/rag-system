Generated answer: According to my knowledge, the Dewey Decimal Classification for the book "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë, published in 1847, is 823.8. 

If we assume the height of the Bronte Tower is 823.8 feet, we can compare it to the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024.

As of my knowledge cutoff, the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City are:

1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet
2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet
3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet
4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet
5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet

The Bronte Tower, at a height of 823.8 feet, would not be among the top 5 tallest buildings in New York City. In fact, it would likely rank outside the top 20 or even top 30 tallest buildings in the city.

To give you a better idea, some notable buildings in New York City with heights around 800-900 feet include:

* The Chrysler Building - 841 feet (excluding antenna)
* The New York Times Building - 814 feet (architectural top)
* One Liberty Plaza - 809 feet

So, the Bronte Tower would likely be comparable in height to these buildings, but still significantly shorter than the tallest skyscrapers in New York City.
