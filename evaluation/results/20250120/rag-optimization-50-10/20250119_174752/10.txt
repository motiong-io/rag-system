Generated answer: The Australian artist you are referring to is Clarice Beckett, but I couldn't find any information that confirms she had a painting featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923.

However, another Australian artist, Dora Wilson (also known as Dora ratcliffe), was a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and her painting "The Corner of the Studio" was featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923.
