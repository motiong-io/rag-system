Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. Identify the largest ward in Monaco: According to the observations, the largest ward in Monaco is Monte Carlo.
2. Determine the General Motors vehicle named after it: The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is named after Monte Carlo.
3. Find the first model year of this vehicle: The first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo is 1970.
4. Consider how many people had walked on the moon as of 1970: As of 1970, only one mission (Apollo 11) had successfully landed humans on the moon in July 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin being the first two people to walk on its surface.

Therefore, as of December 31st, 1969 (the end of that calendar year before moving into a new model year for vehicles), only two individuals had walked on the moon's surface during Apollo missions up until that point - specifically during Apollo missions up until that point - but by considering other early lunar landings like Apollo's subsequent successful landing with Pete Conrad and Alan Bean walking during their November '69 mission; thus making four total prior January '70 when looking at those having physically set foot upon our Moon so far within recorded human spaceflight history leading right into an automotive-related query here today!
