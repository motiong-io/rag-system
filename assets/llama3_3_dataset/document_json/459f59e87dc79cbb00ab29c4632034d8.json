During the subsequent Shang (c.\u20091600\u20131046 BCE) and Zhou (1046\u2013256 BCE) dynasties, rulers were referred to as *Wang* \u738b, meaning king. China was fully united for the first time by Qin Shi Huang (r.\u2009259\u2013210 BCE), who established the first Imperial dynasty, adopting the title *Huangdi* (\u7687\u5e1d), meaning Emperor, which remained in use until the Imperial system's fall in 1912\\.\n\nAt no point during Ancient or Imperial China was there a formalized means to confer legitimate succession between rulers. From the Zhou dynasty onwards, monarchs justified their reigns by claiming the Mandate of Heaven (\u5929\u547d; *Ti\u0101nm\u00ecng*).\\[b] The mandate held that a ruler and their successors had permission from the heavens to rule as long as they did so effectively. It also declared a ruler the Son of Heaven (\u5929\u5b50; *Ti\u0101nz\u01d0*), giving them the right to rule \"all under heaven\" (\u5929\u4e0b; *Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0*). Given the Mandate's subjective nature, rulers also utilized a variety of methods to retain support and justify their accession. This ranged from military enforcement, political patronage, establishing peace and solidity, institutional reform, and historical revisionism to legitimize the dissolution of previous dynasties and their own succession. For most of Imperial China, the *wuxing* (\u4e94\u884c; \"Five Elements\") philosophical scheme was also central to justify dynastic succession.\n\nMost Chinese monarchs had many names. They were given a personal name (\u540d\u5b57; *M\u00edngzi*) at birth, but later referred to by a posthumous name (\u8b1a\u865f; *Sh\u00ech\u00e0o*)\u2014which memorialized their accomplishments or character\u2014due to a cultural naming taboo. Most emperors of the Imperial period also received a temple name (\u5edf\u865f; *Mi\u00e0oh\u00e0o*), used to venerate them in ancestor worship. From the rule of Emperor Wu of Han (r.\u2009141\u201387 BCE) onwards,\\[c] emperors also adopted one or several era names (\u5e74\u865f; *Ni\u00e1nh\u00e0o*), or \"reign mottos\", to divide their rule by important events or accomplishments. Ming (1368\u20131644\\) and Qing (1644\u20131912\\) rulers are referred to solely by their era names, of which they only had one.\n\nApart from ethnic Han rulers, China was also ruled by various non-Han monarchs, including Jurchen, Khitan, Manchu, Mongol and Tangut and many others. To justify their reign, non-Han rulers sometimes aligned themselves with the Confucian sages or the *Chakravarti* of Chinese Buddhism. There are numerous lengthy periods where many competing kingdoms claimed the throne, many of whose legitimacy is still debated by scholars.\n\nAncient China\n-------------\n\n### Mythological rulers\n\nIn traditional Chinese historiography, various models of mythological founding rulers exist. The relevancy of these figures to the earliest Chinese people is unknown, since most accounts of them were written from the Warring States period (c.\u2009475\u2013221 BCE) onwards. The sinologist Kwang-chih Chang has generalized the typical stages: \"the first period was populated by gods, the second by demigods/culture hero, and the third by the legendary kings.\" The primordial god Pangu is given by many texts as the earliest figure and is credited with forming the world by separating heaven and earth. Other gods include N\u00fcwa, who repaired heaven; Hou Yi, a mythical archer; and Gonggong, a serpent-like water deity.\n\nDemigod and hero rulers from hero myths\u2014the largest group Chinese myths\u2014are attributed the invention of specific items, practices or traditions. Among the more important of them are Fuxi, the inventor of hunting; Suiren, who invented fire; and Shennong, who invented both agriculture and medicine. The subsequent legendary kings began with the Yellow Emperor (\u9ec3\u5e1d), known as *Huangdi*, a major culture hero of Chinese civilization whose reign was considered exemplary. Succeeding rulers include some combination of Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun. Since the late Warring States onwards, early Chinese monarchs have traditionally been ground into the concept of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors; however, the chosen figures of this grouping varies considerably between sources. Generally, most accounts include at least Fuxi and Shennong among the Three Sovereigns as well as the Yellow Emperor, Yao and Shun among the Five Emperors.\n\n### Xia dynasty\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period was followed by the Xia dynasty in traditional historiography. Founded by Yu the Great, both the dynasty and its rulers are of highly uncertain and controversial historicity.\n\nXia dynasty (\u590f\u671d)\n\n| Name | Speculative reign length\\[d] | | Traditional succession | Capital | Purported life details |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ZTW | Trad |\n| **Yu**\u79b9 | 45 | 7 | Chosen by the mythical Emperor Shun | Ji | Awarded the throne after his institution of flood control.

The oldest such oracle bones date to the Late Shang (c.\u20091250\u20141046 BCE), during the reign of Wu Ding (1250\u20131192\\), putting the exact details of earlier rulers into doubt.\n\nShang dynasty (\u5546\u671d; c. 1600\u20131046/c. 1570\u20141045 BCE)\n\n| Posthumous name | Personal name | Tentative reign (BCE)\\[e] | | Traditional succession | Residence | Purported life details |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| XSZ Project | CHAC |\n| Early Shang\\[edit] | | | | | | | | |\n| **Tang**\u6c64   ---  **Da Yi**\u5927\u4e59 | Zi L\u00fc\u5b50\u5c65 | fl.\u2009c.\u20091600 | fl.\u2009c.\u20091570 | Defeated the purportedly tyrannous Jie of Xia at the Battle of Mingtiao and established the Shang dynasty | Bo, then Shangyi | Traditionally considered a noble and virtuous ruler |\n|  | | | | | | |\n| **Da Ding** (\\#)\u5927\u4e01   ---  **Tai Ding** (\\#)\u592a\u4e01 | *unknown* | \u2013 | \u2013 | Son of Tang | \u2013 | Uncertain whether he was ever enthroned; may have died before succeeding his father |\n|  | | | | | | |\n| **Wai Bing**\u5916\u4e19 | Zi Sheng\u5b50\u52dd | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Tang | Bo | \u2014 |\n|  | | | | | | |\n| **Zhong Ren** (\\#)\u4e2d\u58ec | Zi Yong\u5b50\u5eb8 | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Tang | Bo | Not listed in the oracle bones inscriptions |\n|  | | | | | | |\n| **Tai Jia**\u592a\u7532 | Zi Zhi\u5b50\u81f3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Da Ding | Bo | Traditionally considered an autocratic and cruel ruler |\n|  | | | | | | |\n| **Wo Ding** (\\#)\u6c83\u4e01   ---  **Qiang Ding**\u7f8c\u4e01 | Zi Xuan\u5b50\u7d62 | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Tai Jia | Bo | His name is not found in oracle bone inscriptions, making his certainty as a ruler less secure. |\n|  | | | | | | |\n| **Tai Geng**\u592a\u5e9a   ---  **Da Geng**\u5927\u5e9a | Zi Bian\u5b50\u8faf | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Tai Jia | Bo | \u2013 |\n| **Xiao Jia**\u5c0f\u7532 | Zi Gao\u5b50\u9ad8 | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Tai Geng | Bo | \u2013 |\n| **Yong Ji**\u96cd\u5df1 | Zi Zhou\u5b50\u4f37 | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Tai Geng | Bo | May have reigned after Tai Wu |\n| **Tai Wu**\u592a\u620a   ---  **Da Wu**\u5927\u620a | Zi Mi\u5b50\u5bc6 | \u2014 | \u2014 | Son of Tai Geng | Bo | Said to have had a particularly long reign; one source records 75 years.
