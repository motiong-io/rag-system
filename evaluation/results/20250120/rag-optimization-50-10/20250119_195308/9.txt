        Who is the Pope born Pietro Barbo?:
The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He was born on February 23, 1417, in Venice, and served as the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from August 30, 1464, until his death on July 26, 1471.

What long-running war did Pope Paul II end two years after his papacy began?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order. Pope Paul II helped to negotiate the Second Peace of Thorn, which was signed on October 10, 1466, two years after his papacy began in 1464.

What famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry, took place 400 years earlier than the end of the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order ended in 1466. 

400 years earlier than that would be 1266. The famous conflict that took place around that time and was immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry is the Norman Conquest of England, which occurred in 1066, approximately 200 years before 1266. However, another conflict that fits this timeframe is the Battle of Lewes, which took place in 1264, and is sometimes depicted in artwork and tapestries.

It's worth noting that there might not be a specific conflict exactly 400 years before the end of the Thirteen Years' War (i.e., in 1266) that is widely known to be immortalized in a tapestry. If you have more information or context about this question, I'd be happy to try and help further!


        


Generated answer: The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He ended the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order two years after his papacy began. 

The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466. If we go back 400 years from that date, we get to around 1266. However, a famous conflict that is immortalized in tapestry and took place approximately around that time is not exactly found, but one famous conflict that fits a similar timeframe and is immortalized in tapestry is the Battle of Lewes (1264) or more famously, the Norman Conquest of England (1066), which is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry.

So while there might not be an exact match for a conflict 400 years earlier that's widely known to be immortalized in a tapestry, one of the most famous conflicts from around that general time period that is depicted in a tapestry would likely be the Norman Conquest of England or possibly something like the Battle of Lewes.
