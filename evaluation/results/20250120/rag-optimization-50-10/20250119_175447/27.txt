Generated answer: Although the provided context does not specifically mention the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945-1947, we can make an educated guess based on the information available.

In the traditional 4-4-2 system in the UK, squad numbers 1-11 would usually have been assigned to specific positions. Typically, the centre-forward would wear the number 9 jersey. 

Given that Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward, it is likely that he would have worn the number 9 jersey while playing for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947. However, please note that this is an inference and not a definitive answer, as the exact numbering system used by Chelsea FC during those years is not specified in the provided context.
