        obersevations:
        Who is the Pope born Pietro Barbo?:
The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He was the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 1464 to 1471.

What long-running war did Pope Paul II end two years after his papacy began?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order. Pope Paul II helped to negotiate the Second Peace of Thorn, which was signed on October 10, 1466, two years after his papacy began in 1464.

What famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry, took place 400 years earlier than the end of the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order?:
The Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order ended in 1466. 

400 years earlier than that would be approximately 1266. 

The famous conflict that took place around that time and was immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry is the Norman Conquest of England, which occurred in 1066, not 1266. However, it's possible that you might be thinking of this event, given its fame and the fact that it was immortalized in tapestry.


        


Generated answer: The Pope born Pietro Barbo is Pope Paul II. He ended the Thirteen Years' War between the Polish Crown and the Teutonic Order two years after his papacy began.

The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466. If we go back 400 years from that date, we get approximately 1266.

However, I think I have a more famous conflict in mind that was immortalized in tapestry, which took place around that time period, although not exactly 400 years earlier. The Norman Conquest of England, which occurred in 1066, was immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry. It's possible that this is the conflict you are thinking of, given its fame and historical significance.
