It comprises representatives from 21 state parties that are elected by the **General Assembly of States Parties** for a four-year term. These parties vote on decisions and proposals related to the World Heritage Convention and World Heritage List. \n\nAccording to the World Heritage Convention, a committee member's term of office is six years. However many States Parties choose to voluntarily limit their term to four years, in order to give other States Parties an opportunity to serve. All members elected at the 15th General Assembly (2005\\) voluntarily chose to reduce their term of office from six to four years.\n\nDeliberations of the World Heritage Committee are aided by three advisory bodies, the IUCN, ICOMOS and ICCROM.\n\nSessions\n--------\n\nThe World Heritage Committee meets once a year for an ordinary session to discuss the management of existing World Heritage Sites, and accept nominations by countries. Extraordinary meetings can be convened at the request of two-thirds of the state members. Meetings are held within the territory of state members of the World Heritage Committee at their invitation. Rotation between regions and cultures is a consideration for selection and the location for the next session is chosen by the committee at the end of each session.\n\n| Session | Year | Date | Host city |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 1977 | 27 June\u20131 July | Paris |\n| 2 | 1978 | 5 September\u20138 September | Washington, D.C. |\n| 3 | 1979 | 22 October\u201326 October | Cairo \\& Luxor |\n| 4 | 1980 | 1 September\u20135 September | Paris |\n| 5 | 1981 | 26 October\u201330 October | Sydney |\n| 6 | 1982 | 13 December\u201317 December | Paris |\n| 7 | 1983 | 5 December\u20139 December | Florence |\n| 8 | 1984 | 29 October\u20132 November | Buenos Aires |\n| 9 | 1985 | 2 December\u20136 December | Paris |\n| 10 | 1986 | 24 November\u201328 November | Paris |\n| 11 | 1987 | 7 December\u201311 December | Paris |\n| 12 | 1988 | 5 December\u20139 December | Bras\u00edlia |\n| 13 | 1989 | 11 December\u201315 December | Paris |\n| 14 | 1990 | 7 December\u201312 December | Banff |\n| 15 | 1991 | 9 December\u201313 December | Carthage |\n| 16 | 1992 | 7 December\u201314 December | Santa Fe |\n| 17 | 1993 | 6 December\u201311 December | Cartagena |\n| 18 | 1994 | 12 December\u201317 December | Phuket |\n| 19 | 1995 | 4 December\u20139 December | Berlin |\n| 20 | 1996 | 2 December\u20137 December | M\u00e9rida |\n| 21 | 1997 | 1 December\u20136 December | Naples |\n| 22 | 1998 | 30 November\u20135 December | Kyoto |\n| 23 | 1999 | 29 November\u20134 December | Marrakech |\n| 24 | 2000 | 27 November\u20132 December | Cairns |\n| 25 | 2001 | 11 December\u201316 December | Helsinki |\n| 26 | 2002 | 24 June\u201329 June | Budapest |\n| 27 | 2003 | 30 June\u20135 July | Paris |\n| 28 | 2004 | 28 June\u20137 July | Suzhou |\n| 29 | 2005 | 10 July\u201317 July | Durban |\n| 30 | 2006 | 8 July\u201316 July | Vilnius |\n| 31 | 2007 | 23 June\u20131 July | Christchurch |\n| 32 | 2008 | 2 July\u201310 July | Quebec City |\n| 33 | 2009 | 22 June\u201330 June | Seville |\n| 34 | 2010 | 25 July\u20133 August | Bras\u00edlia |\n| 35 | 2011 | 19 June\u201329 June | Paris |\n| 36 | 2012 | 25 June\u20135 July | Saint Petersburg |\n| 37 | 2013 | 17 June\u201327 June | Phnom Penh |\n| 38 | 2014 | 15 June\u201325 June | Doha |\n| 39 | 2015 | 28 June\u20138 July | Bonn |\n| 40 | 2016 | 10 July\u201320 July | Istanbul |\n| 41 | 2017 | 2 July\u201312 July | Krak\u00f3w |\n| 42 | 2018 | 24 June\u20134 July | Manama |\n| 43 | 2019 | 30 June\u201310 July | Baku |\n| 44 | 2020\u201321 | 16 July\u201331 July 2021*Originally scheduled for 2020\\.
