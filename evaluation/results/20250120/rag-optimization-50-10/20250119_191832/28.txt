To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Subtract 1963 from 2009: 2009 - 1963 = 46
2. Determine the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024. According to the provided contexts, as of 2016, there were 18 regions (13 metropolitan and 5 overseas). There is no information provided that this number has changed since then. Therefore, we will use 18 as the number of administrative regions.
