However, the combined region of Upper and Lower Normandy was simply called \"Normandy\" (*Normandie*). Permanent names were proposed by the new regional councils by 1 July 2016 and new names confirmed by the *Conseil d'\u00c9tat* by 30 September 2016\\. The legislation defining the new regions also allowed the Centre region to officially change its name to \"Centre-Val de Loire\" with effect from January 2015\\.\nTwo regions,

|\n\n(Occitania)\n\nRole\n----\n\nRegions lack separate legislative authority and therefore cannot write their own statutory law. They levy their own taxes and, in return, receive a decreasing\\[*clarification needed*] part of their budget from the central government, which gives them a portion of the taxes it levies. They also have considerable budgets managed by a regional council *(conseil r\u00e9gional)* made up of representatives voted into office in regional elections.\n\nA region's primary responsibility is to build and furnish high schools. In March 2004, the French central government unveiled a controversial plan to transfer regulation of certain categories of non-teaching school staff to the regional authorities. Critics of this plan contended that tax revenue was insufficient to pay for the resulting costs, and that such measures would increase regional inequalities.\n\nIn addition, regions have considerable discretionary power over infrastructural spending, e.g., education, public transit, universities and research, and assistance to business owners. This has meant that the heads of wealthy regions such as \u00cele-de-France or Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes can be high-profile positions.\n\nProposals to give regions limited legislative autonomy have met with considerable resistance; others propose transferring certain powers from the departments to their respective regions, leaving the former with limited authority.\n\n### Regional control\n\nNumber of regions controlled by each coalition since 1986\\.\n\n| Elections | Presidencies | | | Map |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Left | Right | Other |\n| 1986 | 5 | **21** | \u2013 |  |\n| 1992 | 4 | **21** | 1 |  |\n| 1998 | 10 | **15** | 1 |  |\n| 2004 | **23** | 2 | 1 |  |\n| 2010 | **23** | 3 | \u2013 |  |\n| 2015 | 7 | **8** | 2 |  |\n| 2021 | 6 | **8** | 4 |  |\n\nOverseas regions\n----------------\n\n**Overseas region** (French: *R\u00e9gion d'outre-mer*) is a recent designation, given to the overseas departments that have similar powers to those of the regions of metropolitan France. As integral parts of the French Republic, they are represented in the National Assembly, Senate and Economic and Social Council, elect a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and use the euro as their currency.\n\nAlthough these territories have had these political powers since 1982, when France's decentralisation policy dictated that they be given elected regional councils along with other regional powers, the designation *overseas regions* dates only to the 2003 constitutional change; indeed, the new wording of the constitution aims to give no precedence to either appellation *overseas department* or *overseas region*, although the second is still virtually unused by French media.\n\nThe following have overseas region status:\n\n* in the Indian Ocean (Africa):\n\t+ **Mayotte**\n\t+ **R\u00e9union**\n* in the Americas:\n\t+ **French Guiana** in South America\n\t+ **Guadeloupe** in the Antilles (Caribbean)\n\t+ **Martinique** in the Antilles (Caribbean)\n\n* **Mayotte**\n* **R\u00e9union**\n\n* **French Guiana** in South America\n* **Guadeloupe** in the Antilles (Caribbean)\n* **Martinique** in the Antilles (Caribbean)\n\n* \n*", "chunks": [{"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Regions_of_France_0", "original_index": 0, "content": "| Regions of France*R\u00e9gions* (French) | |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Also known as: * *Rannvroio\u00f9 Bro-C'hall* (Breton), *R\u00e8gion franc\u00easa* (Arpitan), *Region francesa* (Occitan), *Regi\u00f3 francesa* (Catalan) | |\n| Hauts-de-France Normandy \u00cele-de-France Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 Centre-Val de Loire Pays de la Loire Brittany Nouvelle-Aquitaine Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Occitania Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur Corsica French Guiana Guadeloupe Martinique Mayotte R\u00e9unionBelgium Luxembourg Germany Switzerland Liechtenstein Italy Monaco United Kingdom Andorra Brazil Suriname SpainChannel Bay ofBiscay LigurianSea MediterraneanSea | |\n| Category | Unitary state |\n| Location | French Republic |\n| Number | 18 |\n| Possible status | * Overseas region (*r\u00e9gion d'outre-mer*) (5\\) |\n| Additional status | * Territorial collectivity (*collectivit\u00e9 territoriale*) |\n| Populations | 279,471 (Mayotte) \u2013 12,997,058 (\u00cele-de-France) |", "contextualized_text": "**Context for Search Retrieval:**\n\"**Initial Overview Section**: Summary table providing basic information about the 18 administrative regions of France, including names, categorization, location, count, statuses, and population range, located at the **beginning of the document**, preceding in-depth details about French regions.\""}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Regions_of_France_1", "original_index": 1, "content": "| Populations | 279,471 (Mayotte) \u2013 12,997,058 (\u00cele-de-France) |\n| Areas | 376 km2 (145 sq mi) (Mayotte) \u2013 84,061 km2 (32,456 sq mi) (Nouvelle-Aquitaine) |\n| Government | * Regional Government, National Government |\n| Subdivisions | * Department |", "contextualized_text": "**Administrative Overview of French Regions**\n\n* **Location within document:** Directly under the introductory section \"Regions of France\" (R\u00e9gions), preceding the detailed listings of individual regions. \n* **Surrounding content:** Precedes the historical section (\"History\") and follows the introductory section listing the 18 regions of France. \n* **Relevant categories:** Demographics (Population, Area), Governance, and Administrative Hierarchy."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Regions_of_France_2", "original_index": 2, "content": "* Also known as:\n* *Rannvroio\u00f9 Bro-C'hall* (Breton), *R\u00e8gion franc\u00easa* (Arpitan), *Region francesa* (Occitan), *Regi\u00f3 francesa* (Catalan)\n\n* Overseas region (*r\u00e9gion d'outre-mer*) (5\\)\n\n* Territorial collectivity (*collectivit\u00e9 territoriale*)\n\n* Regional Government, National Government\n\n* Department\n\nFrance is divided into eighteen administrative **regions** (French: *r\u00e9gions*, singular *r\u00e9gion* \\[\u0281e\u0292j\u0254\u0303]), of which thirteen are located in metropolitan France (in Europe), while the other five are overseas regions (not to be confused with the overseas collectivities, which have a semi-autonomous status).", "contextualized_text": "**Context:** \n* **Section:** Introduction to French Administrative Divisions\n* **Topic:** Overview of Regions in France\n* **Location:** Likely early in the document, preceding detailed listings and historical context of French regions."}, {"uuid": null, "chunk_id": "Regions_of_France_3", "original_index": 3, "content": "All of the thirteen metropolitan administrative regions (including Corsica as of 2019\\[update]) are further subdivided into two to thirteen administrative departments, with the prefect of each region's administrative centre's department also acting as the regional prefect.
