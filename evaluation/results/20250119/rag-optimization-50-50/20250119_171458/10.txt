        Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart?:
Although there isn't enough information in the text to determine who the Australian artist is, I found that another notable Australian artist, Norman Lindsay, was indeed born in 1879, but that is 4 years before Janet Cumbrae Stewart. However, I also found that another Australian artist, Percy Leason, was born the same year (1883) and in the same state (Victoria) as Janet Cumbrae Stewart, but I couldn't verify if he is the exact artist you are looking for. If you have more information or context, please let me know so I can try to give a more accurate answer.

Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart and a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors?:
According to the provided context, Clarice Beckett (1887–1935) is not the answer since she was born 4 years after Janet Cumbrae Stewart. 

The answer is not explicitly stated, but based on the provided information, I can suggest that one of the following artists might be born in the same year (1883):

* No explicit information is provided about an artist born the same year. 

However, some of the listed artists were born around the same time. For example:
* Cristina Asquith Baker was born in 1868
* Alice Marian Ellen Bale was born in 1875
* Ethel Carrick was born in 1872
* Margaret Francis Ellen Baskerville was born in 1861

But none of them were born in 1883.

Who is the Australian artist born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart and a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors?:
Clarice Beckett (1887–1935) was not born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart. 

However, among the fellow members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors listed, I found that Cristina Asquith Baker and Ethel Carrick were not born in 1883. Neither was Alice Marian Ellen Bale, Margaret Francis Ellen Baskerville, Lina Bryans, Amalie Sara Colquhoun, Valeria Helen Correll, Sybil Craig, Peggie Crombie, or Maude Edith Victoria Fleay.

The text does not mention another Australian artist who is a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and is born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883).


        


Generated answer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information that directly answers your question. However, I can try to help you narrow down the possibilities.

Since the Australian artist is a fellow member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and was born the same year as Janet Cumbrae Stewart (1883), I can try to find artists who match this criteria.

Although I couldn't find an exact match, I can suggest that the artist might be one of the members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors who was active during the 1920s.

If you have any more information or context about the painting or the artist, I may be able to help you further. Alternatively, if you know the name of the artist, I can try to help you find the title of the painting that was featured on the cover of Women's World Magazine in 1923.
