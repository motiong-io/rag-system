During the ceremony, which begins well before the winter sunrise, Phil emerges from his temporary home on Gobbler's Knob, located in a rural area about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of the town. According to the tradition, if Phil sees his shadow and returns to his hole, he has predicted six more weeks of winter-like weather. If Phil does not see his shadow, he has predicted an \"early spring.\" Punxsutawney's event is the most famous of many Groundhog Day festivals held in the United States and Canada.

The president of the Inner Circle, the only person able to understand Groundhogese through his possession of an ancient acacia wood cane, then interprets Phil's message, and directs the vice president to read the proper scroll to the crowd gathered on Gobbler's Knob and the masses of \"phaithphil phollowers\" tuned in to live broadcasts around the world.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nThe Inner Circle scripts the Groundhog Day ceremonies in advance, with the Inner Circle deciding beforehand whether Phil will see his shadow. The Stormfax Almanac has made note of the weather conditions on each Groundhog Day since 1999; the almanac has recorded 12 incidents in a 20-year span in which the Inner Circle said the groundhog saw his shadow while the sky was cloudy or there was rain or snow coming down, and in one case said the groundhog did not see his shadow despite sunshine. Outside of Groundhog Day, Phil resides with a mate, Phyllis, at the Punxsutawney Memorial Library in a climate-controlled environment. In March 2024, the Inner Circle announced that Phil had sired two babies, the first time in the history of the event that such a siring had happened; the birth surprised the Inner Circle, which had assumed that groundhogs do not breed in captivity. As a result of the births, the family will move permanently to Gobblers Knob. The Inner Circle disowned the babies from ever inheriting their father's position.\n\nPunxsutawney Phil canon\n-----------------------\n\nThe practices and lore of Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are predicated on a light-hearted suspension of disbelief by those involved. According to the lore, there is only one Phil, and all other groundhogs are impostors. It is claimed that this one groundhog has lived to make weather prognostications since 1886, sustained by drinks of \"groundhog punch\" or \"elixir of life\" administered at the annual Groundhog Picnic in the fall. The lifespan of a groundhog in the wild is roughly six years.\n\nAccording to the Groundhog Club, Phil, after the prediction, speaks to the club president in the language of 'Groundhogese', which supposedly only the current president can understand, and then his prediction is translated and revealed to all.\n\nThe Groundhog Day celebration is rooted in Germanic tradition that says that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Christian celebration of Candlemas, winter and cold weather will last another six weeks. If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow all the way into May. When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs. Several other towns in the region hold similar Groundhog Day events.\n\nPhil first received his name in 1961\\. The origins of the name are unclear, but speculation suggests that it may have been indirectly named after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nReception\n---------\n\nPrior to 1993, the Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney attracted crowds of approximately 2,000\\. The popularity of the film *Groundhog Day* brought significantly more attention to the event, with annual crowds rising to 10,000\u201320,000\\. A notable exception was 2021, when the event took place without any crowds due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since approximately 2018, the event is streamed online each year.\n\nAlso given the recent increase in crowd sizes, three sitting governors of Pennsylvania have attended the festivities, all since 2000: Ed Rendell in 2003, Tom Corbett in 2012, and Josh Shapiro in 2023 and 2024\\.\n\nPhil was named the \"Official\" State Meteorologist by Governor Shapiro during the 2024 ceremony.\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals object to the event, claiming that Phil is put under stress. They suggest replacing Phil with a robotic groundhog.\n\nIn some cases where Phil's prognostications have been incorrect, organizations have jokingly made legal threats against the groundhog. Such tongue-in-cheek actions have been made by a prosecutor in Ohio, the sheriff's office of Monroe County, Pennsylvania, and the Merrimack, New Hampshire Police Department.\n\nIn media and popular culture\n----------------------------\n\n* Phil and the town of Punxsutawney were portrayed in the 1993 film *Groundhog Day*. The actual town used to portray Punxsutawney in the film is Woodstock, Illinois.\n* In Groundhog Day, the 2016 Broadway musical adaptation of the film, Phil is ascribed a more mythical role.\n* In 1995, Phil flew to Chicago for a guest appearance on *The Oprah Winfrey Show*, which aired on Groundhog Day, February 2, 1995\\.\n* A 2002 episode of the children's animated series *Stanley*, titled \"Searching for Spring\", featured Punxsutawney Phil.\n* Phil was the main attraction in \"Groundhog Day\", the April 10, 2005 episode of the MTV series *Viva La Bam*. In the episode, street skater Bam Margera holds a downhill race in honor of Punxsutawney Phil at Bear Creek Mountain Resort in Macungie, Pennsylvania.\n* The Pennsylvania Lottery's mascot is a groundhog named Gus, referred to in commercials as \"the second most famous groundhog in Pennsylvania\", in deference to Phil. Because the Groundhog Club Inner Circle has trademarked the use of the name \"Punxsutawney Phil\", no commercial entity may use the name without the permission from the Inner Circle, which does not allow commercialization of the name.\n\nPast predictions\n----------------\n\nPunxsutawney Phil's predictions\n\n|  | | | | | | 1886 | 1887 | 1888 | 1889 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1890 | 1891 | 1892 | 1893 | 1894 | 1895 | 1896 | 1897 | 1898 | 1899 |\n| 1900 | 1901 | 1902 | 1903 | 1904 | 1905 | 1906 | 1907 | 1908 | 1909 |\n| 1910 | 1911 | 1912 | 1913 | 1914 | 1915 | 1916 | 1917 | 1918 | 1919 |\n| 1920 | 1921 | 1922 | 1923 | 1924 | 1925 | 1926 | 1927 | 1928 | 1929 |\n| 1930 | 1931 | 1932 | 1933 | 1934 | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 | 1939 |\n| 1940 | 1941 | 1942 | 1943 | 1944 | 1945 | 1946 | 1947 | 1948 | 1949 |\n| 1950 | 1951 | 1952 | 1953 | 1954 | 1955 | 1956 | 1957 | 1958 | 1959 |\n| 1960 | 1961 | 1962 | 1963 | 1964 | 1965 | 1966 | 1967 | 1968 | 1969 |\n| 1970 | 1971 | 1972 | 1973 | 1974 | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | 1979 |\n| 1980 | 1981 | 1982 | 1983 | 1984 | 1985 | 1986 | 1987 | 1988 | 1989 |\n| 1990 | 1991 | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 |\n| 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 |\n| 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n| 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |\n\n| \"Six more weeks of winter\" (107\\)   \"Early spring\" (20\\)   \"War clouds have blacked out parts of the shadow.\" (1\\)   No appearance (event canceled) (1\\)   No record (10\\) |\n| --- |\n\n### Predictive accuracy\n\nThe Inner Circle, in keeping with the suspension of disbelief, claims a 100% accuracy rate, and an approximately 80% accuracy rate in recorded predictions.
