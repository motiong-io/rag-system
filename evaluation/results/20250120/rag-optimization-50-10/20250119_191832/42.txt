The Boston Braves do not exist as a team anymore. They relocated to Milwaukee in 1953 and are now known as the Atlanta Braves. Therefore, there is no president of the Boston Braves. The list of presidents I have is only up to 1952, and it includes:

* Ivers Whitney Adams (1871)
* John Conkey (1872)
* Charles H. Porter (1873–1874)
* Nicholas Apollonio (1875–1876)
* Arthur Soden (1877–1907)

* John Dovey (1909–1910)

* Emil Fuchs (1925–1935)
* Bob Quinn (1935–1945)
* Lou Perini (1945–1952)

Note that this list only goes up to 1952, as the team relocated to Milwaukee in 1953.


        


Generated answer: The team that inspired the original name of the Washington Commanders is the Boston Braves, which is now known as the Atlanta Braves. Since the Boston Braves do not exist as a team anymore, I'll provide information about the Atlanta Braves.
