        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
The provided text doesn't explicitly state the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947. However, according to the general information provided in the text, it can be inferred that squad numbers were not yet widely adopted during this period.

The Football League introduced squad numbers in the 1939-1940 season, but it was not until the 1999-2000 season that they became compulsory. In the 1940s, teams often used the traditional 1-11 numbering system, with players wearing numbers based on their position on the field.

Since Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea from 1945 to 1947, and the text mentions his squad number and appearances, it can be assumed that Chelsea might have used a numbering system similar to the traditional 1-11 system during that time. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact numbering system used by Chelsea FC during those years.

What position or role did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC, to determine the corresponding squad number?:
Tommy Lawton played as a Centre-forward for Chelsea FC. However, the provided texts do not mention the corresponding squad number for Tommy Lawton during his time at Chelsea FC.


        


Generated answer: Based on the information provided, Tommy Lawton played as a Centre-forward for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947. During that time, teams often used the traditional 1-11 numbering system, with players wearing numbers based on their position on the field.

Traditionally, the Centre-forward position corresponds to the number 9. Therefore, it can be inferred that Tommy Lawton would have likely worn the number 9 jersey while playing for Chelsea FC.
