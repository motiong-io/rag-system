Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to combine the information from the given observations.

The U.S. president who won Alaska is Lyndon B. Johnson.
The U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald R. Ford.

Since these are two different presidents, we need to find out which one of them matches all the criteria given in the question.

Lyndon B. Johnson won Alaska but there's no information that he graduated from Yale University or had a son named Michael.
Gerald R. Ford graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael, but there's no information that he won Alaska.

However, since Lyndon B. Johnson is mentioned as winning Alaska and his middle name is given as Baines, let's assume for a moment that Gerald R. Ford did not win Alaska (which aligns with our data). 

So if we consider Gerald R. Ford (the one who graduated from Yale and had a son named Michael), his full name is Gerald Rudolph Ford, hence 'Rudolph' would be his middle name at birth.


The final answer is Rudolph.

Check result: N
