        Who is the singer of Edge of Seventeen?:
The singer of "Edge of Seventeen" is Stevie Nicks.

What is the current record label of Stevie Nicks as of July 1, 2024?:

However, according to the provided text, in December 2020, music publishing company Primary Wave bought an 80% stake of Nicks' song catalog, but this does not necessarily imply a change in her record label. Therefore, as of July 1, 2024, I can assume that Stevie Nicks is still signed to Reprise Records, but I may not have the most up-to-date information.

What is the parent company of Reprise Records as of July 1, 2024?:
