Generated answer: I couldn't find any information about a pageant winner being murdered by her stalker. The provided contexts don't mention such an incident. However, I can tell you that Małgorzata Rożniecka won the title of Miss International in 2001.

If you're looking for information about a specific pageant winner who was murdered, I found that JonBenet Ramsey, a beauty pageant participant, was murdered in 1996. However, please note that this is not directly related to the context of Miss International or Małgorzata Rożniecka.

If we consider JonBenet Ramsey's murder in 1996 and Małgorzata Rożniecka's win in 2001, the difference would be approximately 5 years.

Check result: N
