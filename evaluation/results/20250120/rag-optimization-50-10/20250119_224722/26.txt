According to the text, the following blue moons occurred between July 28, 1914, and September 2, 1945:

* May 21, 1921
* February 20, 1924

Note that these dates are based on the "Maine rule" definition of a blue moon, which is the third full moon in a season with four full moons. The text also mentions that James Hugh Pruett's definition of a blue moon (the second full moon in a calendar month) was not widely known until the mid-1980s.
