The most common daisy cocktail is the Brandy Daisy. Other commonly known daisies are the Whiskey Daisy, Bourbon Daisy, Gin Daisy, Rum Daisy, Lemon Daisy (the non-alcoholic variant), Portuguese Daisy (port and brandy), vodka daisy, and Champagne daisy. The Margarita and Sidecar (cocktail) are both variants of the Daisy; both use the simplest form of the specification (base spirit, citrus juice, and liqueur) with triple sec as the modifier; the former uses tequila as the base spirit and lime juice, while the latter uses brandy as the base spirit and lemon juice.\n* Fix \u2013 traditional long drink related to Cobblers, but mixed in a shaker and served over crushed ice\n* Fizz \u2013 traditional long drink including acidic juices and club soda, e.g. gin fizz\n* Flip \u2013 traditional half-long drink that is characterized by inclusion of sugar and egg yolk\n* Julep \u2013 base spirit, sugar, and mint over ice.

Some strawberry cocktail recipes do not call for a syrup, but rely on pur\u00e9ed strawberries to play that part.\n\nStrawberries are often mixed with basil. Strawberry is popular in smashes since after the beverage has been drunk, the alcohol-infused strawberries can be consumed as well.\n\n* Champagne bowler (Cognac, white wine, sparkling wine, simple syrup, strawberries)\n* Cherub's cup (vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, brut ros\u00e9 sparkling wine, lemon juice, simple syrup, strawberry)\n* Christmas Jones (vodka, sugar, pineapple juice, lemon-lime soda, strawberries)\n* Fresh strawberry and lime Tom Collins (gin, lime juice, club soda, agave, strawberries)\n* Kentucky kiss (Maker's Mark bourbon, lemon juice, maple syrup, club soda, strawberries)\n* Strawberry beer margarita (tequila, Corona beer, limeade concentrate, lemon lime soda, strawberries)\n* Strawberry berryoska (Russian standard vodka, lemonade, strawberries)\n* Strawberry gin and tonic (gin, lime juice, orange bitters, tonic water, strawberry syrup)\n* Strawberry gin smash (gin, strawberries, sugar, lime juice, elderflower liquor, club soda, mint sprigs)\n* Strawberry mint sparkling limeade (Champagne, mint leaves, lime juice, honey)\n* Strawberry pom mojito (white rum, mint leaves, lime juice, pomegranate juice, club soda or lime soda, strawberries)\n* Strawberry rose gin fizz (gin, sugar, rose water, salt, club soda, strawberries)\n* Strawberry smash (vodka, basil leaves, lemon juice, honey, club soda, strawberries)\n* Strawberry whiskey lemonade (whiskey, lemon juice, strawberry syrup)\n* Strawberry Mango Bourbon Smash (bourbon, strawberries, mango juice, lime juice, sugar syrup, ginger beer)\n\n### Carrot juice\n\nCarrot juice can be mixed with spirits such as agave spirits, whiskey, tequila, gin, or mezcal. Vodka is sometimes chosen because its neutral taste allows more of the carrot juice taste to shine through. Carrot juice can also be mixed with liqueurs such as amaro. ginger, orange, lemon and honey can be other ingredients in carrot juice cocktails. Turmeric infusions are also common. Examples of drinks made with carrot juice include:\n\n* 24 Carrot Gold Punch (gin, carrot juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice, ginger beer, pineapple slices, edible flowers)\n* Jessica Rabbit (Big Gin, carrot juice, yellow Chartreuse, k\u00fcmmel, lime juice, lime oleo saccharum, carrot top oil, arugula flower)\n\n### Pineapple juice\n\n* Chuck Yeager (named after American Air Force Pilot Chuck Yeager.

The history of smashes goes back at least as far as the 1862 book *How to Mix Drinks*. The old-style whiskey smash was an example of an early smash.\n\nThe herb used in a smash is often mint, although basil is sometimes used in cocktails that go well with it, e.g. many strawberry cocktails. The name \"smash\" comes from the idea that on a hot day, one takes whatever fruit is on hand and smashes it all together to make a refreshing beverage. Generally a smash will have crushed ice.\n\n* Apple bourbon smash (bourbon, honeycrisp apple, honey, lemon, nutmeg, cardamom)\n* Blueberry smash (vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, lemon rounds, lime rounds, blueberries, mint leaves)\n* Bourbon blackberry smash (bourbon, lime juice, mint leaves, blackberries, simple syrup, club soda)\n* Bourbon peach smash (bourbon, brown sugar simple syrup, peach, mint leaves, ginger beer or seltzer)\n* Bourbon strawberry smash (bourbon, strawberries, simple syrup, lemon juice, mint leaves, club soda)\n* Cranberry smash (vodka or bourbon, cranberries, mint leaves, lime, brown sugar, ginger ale)\n* Grapefruit smash (cacha\u00e7a, ruby red grapefruit, simple syrup, mint)\n* Kiwi smash (gin, basil leaves, kiwifruit, honey syrup, lemon juice)\n* Pear bourbon smash (bourbon, maple syrup, water, pear, mint leaves, lemon juice)\n* Pineapple smash (spiced rum, pineapple rum, pineapple rings, lime juice, soda water)\n* Raspberry smash (Champagne, vodka, lime wedges, sugar, raspberries)\n* Watermelon smash (Vodka, watermelon juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, mint leaves)\n\n### Lemonade\n\nA number of hard lemonades, such as Lynchburg lemonade (whose alcoholic ingredient is Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey) have been marketed.
