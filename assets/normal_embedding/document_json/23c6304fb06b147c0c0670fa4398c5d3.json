The secretary is a member of the Cabinet of the United States. The position was created by the Homeland Security Act following the attacks of September 11, 2001\\.\n\nThe new department consisted primarily of components transferred from other Cabinet departments because of their role in homeland security, such as the Coast Guard, the Federal Protective Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (which includes the United States Border Patrol), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (which includes Homeland Security Investigations), the United States Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It does not, however, include the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the U.S. Marshals Service. They continue to operate under U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe current secretary of homeland security is Alejandro Mayorkas, since February 2, 2021\\. He is the first Latino and immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nList of secretaries of homeland security\n----------------------------------------\n\nPrior to the establishment of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there existed an assistant to the president for the Office of Homeland Security, which was created following the September 11 attacks in 2001\\.\n\n**Parties**\n  Republican (5\\)\n  Democratic (3\\)\n  Independent (4\\)\n\n**Status**\n  Denotes Acting Homeland Security Secretary\n\n| No. | | Portrait | Name | Senate vote | Term of office | | | State of residence | President | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office | Left office | Duration |\n| 1 |  |  | **Tom Ridge**(born 1945\\) | 94\u20130 | January 24, 2003 | February 1, 2005 | 2 years, 8 days | Pennsylvania |  | George W.

Bush nominated Bernard Kerik for the position in 2004\\. However a week later, Kerik withdrew his nomination, explaining that he had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny.\n\n### Raymond Kelly\n\nBy July 2013, Raymond Kelly had served as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for nearly 12 straight years. Within days of Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano's announcement that she was resigning, Kelly was soon cited as an obvious potential successor by New York senator Charles Schumer and others.\n\nDuring a July 16, 2013, interview, President Obama referred generally to the \"bunch of strong candidates\" for nomination to head the Department of Homeland Security, but singled out Kelly as \"one of the best there is\" and \"very well qualified for the job\".\n\nLater in July 2013, the online internet news website/magazine *Huffington Post* detailed \"a growing campaign to quash the potential nomination of New York City Police commissioner Raymond Kelly as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security\" amid claims of \"divisive, harmful, and ineffective policing that promotes stereotypes and profiling\". Days after that article, Kelly penned a statistics-heavy *Wall Street Journal* opinion article defending the NYPD's programs, stating \"the average number of stops we conduct is less than one per officer per week\" and that this and other practices have led to \"7,383 lives saved\u2014and... they are largely the lives of young men of color.\"\n\nKelly was also featured because of his NYPD retirement and unusually long tenure there in a long segment on the CBS News program *Sunday Morning* in December 2013, especially raising the question of the controversial \"stop and frisk\" policy in New York City and the long decline and drop of various types of crimes committed.\n\nOffice of the Secretary of Homeland Security\n--------------------------------------------\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe Office of the Secretary (OS) oversees the execution of the duties of the Department of Homeland Security. Certain elements also aid the Secretary of Homeland Security and senior officials of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as private sector and government partners in their duties.\n\n### Composition\n\nThe Office of the Secretary contains several offices and other elements of the DHS. Most of the heads of these elements report directly to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary, but the Military Advisor and Executive Secretary report to the **DHS Chief of Staff**, who is currently Jonathan Davidson.\n\nComponents of the Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security\n\n| Component | Mission | Executives | Subordinate Components |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL)**  | * Supports the Department's mission to secure the nation while preserving individual liberty, fairness, and equality under the law. * Builds in civil rights and civil liberties practices into all of the Department\u2019s activities. | * **Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties**: Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia \t+ Deputy Officer for Programs \\& Compliance: Peter Mina \t+ Deputy Officer for EEO and Diversity: Veronica Venture | * **Programs and Compliance Division** * **Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Division** * **Office for Accessible Systems and Technology** (jointly run with DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer) |\n| **Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CISOMB)**  | * Serves as a liaison between the public and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. * Helps individuals and employers resolve issues they are having with USCIS. * Holds engagements to hear from the public about their experiences with USCIS. * Identifies issues in the immigration system and make recommendations to USCIS on how to address these problems. | * **CIS Ombudsman**: Nathan Stiefel (acting) \t+ Deputy Ombudsman: Nathan Stiefel | * **Policy Division** * **Public Engagement Division** * **Casework Division** * **Operations Division** * **Strategy Division** |\n| **Climate Change Action Group**  | * Drives urgent action to address the climate crisis. * Analyzes, on an ongoing basis, the impacts of climate change on DHS missions, assets, and personnel. * Adapts DHS operations, assets, and missions to account for the climate crisis via risk- based strategies. * Coordinates DHS-wide sustainability operations to mitigate additional harm. * Recommends specific, concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. * Recommends specific, concrete steps to promote resilience and adaptation to reduce the multiple risks posed by the climate crisis. * Recommends organizational and resource realignments as necessary to support the Department\u2019s activities to address the climate crisis. | * **Co-Chairs**: Cass Sunstein \\& Robert P.
