Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the publishing company of the magazine that serialized the manga series "Raw Hero", which is Kodansha.
2. Identify the founder of Kodansha, which is Seiji Noma.
3. Identify the year the magazine ended publication, which is 2023.
4. Calculate the age of Seiji Noma in 2023.

Seiji Noma was born in 1878 and died in 1958. 

So, if we calculate his age in 2023: 
2023 - 1878 = 145 years old 

However, since he passed away in 1958, he would not have been alive in 2023. But if we were to calculate how old he would have been: 
He would have been 145 years old.
