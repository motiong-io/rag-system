Generated answer: Based on the information you provided, I believe the Ancient Roman City you are thinking of is Pompeii. 

Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano, in 79 AD. 

As for your question, Pompeii was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980. The session where this decision was made was held in Sydney, Australia, but more specifically, it was at the 4th session of the World Heritage Committee, which took place from September 22 to October 1, 1980, but I couldn't find any information that says it was held in a specific building or location within Sydney.
