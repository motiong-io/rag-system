        obersevations:
        Which U.S. president won Alaska?:
Alaska was purchased from Russia by the United States in 1867, during the presidency of Andrew Johnson. The purchase was negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, and it was finalized on March 30, 1867. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate on April 9, 1867, and Alaska was officially transferred to the United States on October 18, 1867.

So, to answer your question, it was not a presidential election that "won" Alaska, but rather a diplomatic agreement between the United States and Russia that resulted in the purchase of the territory. Andrew Johnson was the president at the time, but it was Seward who played a key role in negotiating the purchase.

Who is the U.S. president that graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael?:
The U.S. president that graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Gerald Ford.

What is the middle name of Andrew Johnson?:
Andrew Johnson's full name is Andrew Johnson, with no middle name. He was the 17th President of the United States.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to identify the U.S. president who "won" Alaska. According to the observations, Alaska was purchased from Russia during the presidency of Andrew Johnson. 

Next, we need to find the U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael. The observations state that this president is Gerald Ford.

Now, we need to find the common link between Andrew Johnson and Gerald Ford, which is not explicitly stated in the observations. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the question is asking about the middle name of Andrew Johnson or Gerald Ford at the time of their birth.

Since Andrew Johnson did not have a middle name, we can look at Gerald Ford. Gerald Ford's full name at birth was Leslie Lynch King Jr. 

So, as of 2024, at the time of his birth, the middle name of the U.S. president who graduated from Yale University and had a son named Michael is Lynch. Note that Gerald Ford was not the president who "won" Alaska, but rather Andrew Johnson was the president at the time of the Alaska purchase.
