        What is the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023?:
The company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is not explicitly stated in the given contexts. However, I can tell you that the ticker symbol 'A' belongs to Agilent Technologies, Inc. and 'AA' belongs to Alcoa Corporation, but 'A' is the first ticker symbol alphabetically. 

So, the answer is 'A' which belongs to Agilent Technologies, Inc.

What is the number of employees of Agilent Technologies, Inc. as of 2023?:
The provided contexts do not mention the number of employees of Agilent Technologies, Inc. as of 2023. However, one of the contexts lists the top 20 employers in a city, but Agilent Technologies, Inc. is not among them. Another context mentions various companies and their number of employees, but Agilent Technologies, Inc. is not included. Therefore, the number of employees of Agilent Technologies, Inc. as of 2023 cannot be determined from the provided contexts.

What is the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023?:
As of 2023, the S&P 500 companies in alphabetical order by ticker symbol are not provided in the given context. However, I can tell you that the information about the S&P 500 companies, including their ticker symbols, can be found on the official S&P Dow Jones Indices website or other financial websites.

That being said, the second-to-last company in the S&P 500 in alphabetical order by ticker symbol is likely to be "Zions Bancorporation" (ZION) or another company with a ticker symbol close to "Z". However, without the most up-to-date information, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

If you're looking for information on a specific company or the S&P 500 index, I suggest checking the official S&P Dow Jones Indices website or other reliable financial sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.


        


Generated answer: To answer this question, I need to make some connections between the observations I have.

First, I know that the company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A).

However, I don't have the exact number of employees of Agilent Technologies, Inc. as of 2023.

Second, I know that the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500 as of 2023 is likely to be "Zions Bancorporation" (ZION), but I don't have confirmation on this.

Lastly, I also don't have the number of employees for the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500.

Given the lack of information on the number of employees for both companies, I'm unable to provide a definitive answer to the question of how many more employees Agilent Technologies, Inc. has compared to the company alphabetically 2nd to last by ticker symbol in the S&P 500. If you're looking for information on a specific company or the S&P 500 index, I suggest checking the official S&P Dow Jones Indices website or other reliable financial sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
