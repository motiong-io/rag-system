Generated answer: To answer this question, I need to follow a series of steps.

First, I need to recall the Dewey Decimal Classification for the Charlotte Bronte book published in 1847, which is 823.8.

Next, I need to imagine a building called Bronte Tower with a height of 823.8 feet.

Then, I need to consider the list of tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024. 

According to the available data, the top 10 tallest buildings in New York City are:
1. One World Trade Center - 1,776 feet
2. Central Park Tower - 1,550 feet
3. 111 West 57th Street - 1,428 feet
4. One Vanderbilt - 1,401 feet
5. 432 Park Avenue - 1,396 feet
6. 30 Hudson Yards - 1,296 feet
7. Empire State Building - 1,250 feet
8. Bank of America Tower - 1,200 feet
9. Three World Trade Center - 1,079 feet
10. 9 DeKalb Avenue - 1,066 feet

Comparing the height of Bronte Tower (823.8 feet) to this list, I can see that it would not be among the top 10 tallest buildings in New York City.

To determine its exact ranking, I would need to consider the heights of other notable buildings in the city. 

Some other notable buildings in New York City and their heights are:
- The New York Times Building - 748 feet
- The Chrysler Building - 751 feet (to the tip) or 630 feet (to the roof)
- The Flatiron Building - 285 feet

Given that the Chrysler Building has a roof height of 630 feet and a total height of 751 feet (to the tip), and the New York Times Building has a height of 748 feet, Bronte Tower at 823.8 feet would be taller than these buildings.

However, without a comprehensive list of all buildings in New York City, it's difficult to provide an exact ranking. Nevertheless, based on the available data, Bronte Tower would likely rank somewhere below the top 10 but above many other notable buildings in the city.

If I had to estimate, considering the heights of some of the notable buildings mentioned above, Bronte Tower might rank somewhere around 20-30th among the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024. However, please note that this is a rough estimate and may not be entirely accurate without more comprehensive data.
