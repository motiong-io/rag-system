Now let's find their populations according to the 1990 United States census:

1. **Oklahoma City - population**: 444,719
2. **Tulsa - population**: 367,302
3. **Norman - population**: 80,071 (Actually less than 100,000)

The total population of these cities in Oklahoma according to the 1990 United States census is:
444,719 + 367,302 + other city which was not explicitly mentioned but for completeness lets include it 
 Broken Arrow had a population of less than fifty thousand so we will ignore that and only use
