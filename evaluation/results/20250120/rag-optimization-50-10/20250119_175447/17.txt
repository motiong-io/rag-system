        What are the U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference?:
The U.S. state capital cities that are home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference are:

1. Denver, Colorado - The University of Colorado, which announced it would rejoin the Big 12 in 2024 is not an outgoing member but was a former member, is based in Boulder but close to Denver.
2. Salt Lake City, Utah - The University of Utah, which announced it would leave for the Big 12 in 2024, is an outgoing member.
3. Phoenix, Arizona - Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, which announced they would leave for the Big 12 in 2024, are outgoing members.

Additionally, the U.S. state capital cities that are home to a former full member of the Big 12 Conference are:

1. Columbia, Missouri - The University of Missouri was a former full member of the Big 12 Conference before it left for the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 2012.
2. Lincoln, Nebraska - The University of Nebraska–Lincoln was a former full member of the Big 12 Conference before it left for the Big Ten Conference in 2011.
3. Austin, Texas - Texas A&M University was a former full member of the Big 12 Conference before it left for the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 2012.

Denver, Colorado; Salt Lake City, Utah; Phoenix, Arizona; Columbia, Missouri; Lincoln, Nebraska; Austin, Texas?:
These cities appear to be related to the Big 12 Conference, as they are home to some of the conference's member universities:

1. Denver, Colorado - University of Colorado
2. Salt Lake City, Utah - University of Utah
3. Phoenix, Arizona - Arizona State University
4. Columbia, Missouri - University of Missouri (note: Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC in 2012)
5. Lincoln, Nebraska - University of Nebraska
6. Austin, Texas - University of Texas

All of these cities, except Columbia, Missouri, are still part of the Big 12 Conference.

What is the U.S. state capital city that is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference and whose university was attended by at least one U.S. president?:
The answer is Colorado, with its state capital being Denver, but more specifically, Boulder, home to the University of Colorado Boulder. The University of Colorado Boulder was attended by William Harrison "Bill" Shaffer (not a U.S. president), but more notably, the University of Colorado Law School, also in Boulder, was briefly attended by William "Bill" Cohen is not correct, however,  the  38th Vice President of the United States, Alben W. Barkley's son attended and  the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre Salinger attended and taught there.



However the city most likely being referred to here is Boulder's neighboring city of Denver which isn't home to a university attended by a U.S president but rather the answer lies in another U.S state capital city where a different former Big 12 university is situated. This city is Columbia in the state of Missouri but it is not the answer because unlike Colorado - Missouri's university was never part of Pac 12 and though it did have a U.S president (the 33rd - Harry S. Truman) attend the University of Missouri, Truman attended the University of Missouri at Kansas City law school satellite campus in Kansas City for a couple years but dropped out and later went on to graduate from a different college - not at Mizzou, so while Truman did have an association to a college that was formerly part of Big 12 - he did not attend Mizzou itself long enough for it to be said he attended.



Given this information we can confidently say the correct answer is Lincoln in Nebraska as it was home to a Big 12 team - Nebraska Cornhuskers (which has since changed conference) and a U.S president who briefly attended there was the 26th U.S president - Theodore Roosevelt Jr - however his time at Nebraska was only briefly for a single year (and later going on to attend and graduate from a different Ivy League university) Theodore along with his son (also named Theodore) have both, at differing times briefly attended school there however Theodore Jr - as U.S president is likely who you were thinking of when asking this question regarding this unique set of criteria.


        


Generated answer: Based on the information provided, the U.S. state capital city that is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference and whose university was attended by at least one U.S. president is Lincoln, Nebraska. 

As of my knowledge cutoff, the mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska is Leirion Gaylor Baird. Therefore, the first name of the mayor of the U.S. state capital city who attended the same university as at least one U.S. president (Theodore Roosevelt Jr.) and whose city is home to an outgoing or former full member of the Big 12 Conference is Leirion.
