Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the publishing company of the magazine that serialized the manga series Raw Hero.
2. Identify the founder of that publishing company.
3. Determine the birth year of the founder.
4. Calculate the age of the founder in the year the magazine ended publication.

- The magazine that serialized Raw Hero is "Evening".
- The publisher of "Evening" is Kodansha.
- The founder of Kodansha is Seiji Noma, born in 1878.
- The magazine "Evening" ended publication in 2023.

Now, let's calculate the age:
Seiji Noma was born in 1878 and would have been 145 years old in 2023 if he were alive.

So, if Seiji Noma were alive, he would have been 145 years old when "Evening" ended publication.
