Question: Using the Pruett rule, out of all of the blue moons that occurred between the beginning of World War I and the end of World War II, how many of them occurred on the 31st of the month?
Ground truth: 9

Generated answer: According to the text, a calendrical blue moon (by Pruett's definition) occurs when there are two full moons in a calendar month. This happens because the time between successive full moons (approximately 29.5 days) is shorter than the average calendar month.

To determine how many blue moons occurred on the 31st of the month between World War I and World War II, we need to look at the months with 31 days: January, March, May, July, August, October, and December.

Since a blue moon is the second full moon in a month, it can only occur in these months if the first full moon occurs early enough in the month for a second full moon to occur before the end of the month.

The text does not provide specific dates for all blue moons during this period. However, it does mention that "When there are two Pruett blue moons in a single year, the first occurs in January and the second in March or April." This implies that January and March are possible months for blue moons on the 31st.

Additionally, we know that "the next time New Year's Eve falls on a Pruett blue moon...is after one Metonic cycle, in 2028..." This suggests that December 31 can be a date for a blue moon.

Without specific data on all blue moons during this period, we cannot give an exact count of how many occurred on the 31st of the month. However, based on general principles and given information:

- A blue moon can occur on January 31.
- A blue moon can occur on March 31.
- A blue moon can occur on December 31.

There is no indication from provided information that any other months with 31 days (May, July, August, October) would have had enough time for two full moons within them during this specific period.

It's also worth noting that calculating exact dates of past or future Blue Moons requires detailed astronomical data which isn't fully provided here. The occurrence of Blue Moons follows predictable patterns due to lunar cycles but pinpointing exact occurrences within historical periods without direct access to those astronomical events' records poses challenges.
