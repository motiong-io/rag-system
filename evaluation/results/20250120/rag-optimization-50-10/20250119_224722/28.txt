        What year was William McCrary "Billy" Ray II born?:
William McCrary "Billy" Ray II was born in 1963.

What year was Obama first sworn in as President to the United States?:
According to the text, Barack Obama was first sworn in as President of the United States on January 20, 2009.

If you subtract 1963 from 2009 and multiply it by the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024, what number would you get?:
To calculate the result, we need to follow the steps:

1. Subtract 1963 from 2009: 2009 - 1963 = 46
2. Determine the number of administrative regions in France as of January 1, 2024. According to the provided contexts, as of 2016, there were 18 regions (13 metropolitan and 5 overseas) in France, and there is no information provided that this number has changed since then. Therefore, we assume the number of regions is still 18.
3. Multiply the result from step 1 by the number of regions: 46 * 18 = 828

So, the result would be 828.
