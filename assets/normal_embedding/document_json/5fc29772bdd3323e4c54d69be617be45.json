Known for his technical skills, creativity, passing skills, and vision, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders and playmakers of his generation. He could also play as a wide midfielder.\n\nBorn and raised in Gelsenkirchen, \u00d6zil began his senior club career playing for hometown club Schalke 04, before signing with Werder Bremen in 2008, aged 19\\. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, his individual performances led to a move to Real Madrid in 2010\\. There, he helped the club win a La Liga title, and ranked first in league assists for three straight seasons. In 2013, \u00d6zil signed for Arsenal in a transfer worth up to \u00a342\\.5 million (\u20ac50 million), becoming the most expensive German player ever at the time. It was also a club-record transfer fee for Arsenal until 2017\\. In England, he won four FA Cups and helped end Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought, while recording the second most assists ever (19\\) in a Premier League season. In 2021, \u00d6zil joined Fenerbah\u00e7e on a free transfer; after his contract with the club was terminated in 2022, he signed with \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, before retiring in 2023\\.\n\nA German international for over nine years, \u00d6zil holds the record for the most German National Team Player of the Year awards (5\\). He made his senior debut for the Germany national team in 2009 at age 20, and appeared in five major tournaments. He was the top assist provider at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, where he helped Germany twice reach the semi-final. \u00d6zil helped Germany win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but retired from international competition in 2018, alleging discrimination and disrespect by the German Football Association (DFB) and the German media.\n\nEarly life\n----------\n\n\u00d6zil was born on 15 October 1988 in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, as a son of Turkish immigrants. His grandfather moved as a *Gastarbeiter* from Zonguldak, Turkey to West Germany. He played, at youth level, for various clubs in Gelsenkirchen during 1995\u20132000, before a five-year stint for Rot-Weiss Essen.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nClub career\n-----------\n\n### Schalke 04\n\nIn 2005, \u00d6zil moved to the youth system of Schalke 04\\. He was deployed a midfielder and wore 17 as his squad number, after starting as a playmaker and central attacking midfielder in the place of the suspended Lincoln in DFL-Ligapokal matches against Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich. Upon making the first team at Schalke, he was described as \"the next big thing\". However, soon after declining an offer from Schalke 04, claiming that a yearly salary of \u20ac1\\.5 million would not be enough, he eventually fell out with club management and moved on to Werder Bremen in January 2008\\. This led to Mirko Slomka, the then-Schalke manager, claiming that \u00d6zil would not play another match for Schalke.\n\n### Werder Bremen\n\nOn 31 January 2008, \u00d6zil moved to Werder Bremen for a reported fee of \u20ac5 million, signing a contract with the German club until 30 June 2011\\. Other than Werder Bremen, Hannover 96 and VfB Stuttgart were reportedly interested as well in binding \u00d6zil to their respective clubs, however did not want to pay such a high transfer fee. After transferring to Werder Bremen, \u00d6zil got the jersey number 11\\. On 26 April 2008 (30th match day) \u00d6zil scored the go-ahead goal in the 33rd minute against Karlsruher SC, to put his team up 2\u20131\\. This was \u00d6zil's first Bundesliga goal. He played in twelve games throughout the second half of the season, six times playing in the starting formation, becoming second with Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga at the end of the 2007\u201308 season.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nAlthough Bremen failed to get going in their 2008\u201309 Bundesliga season, eventually finishing a disappointing tenth, \u00d6zil managed to make a significant impact in most games and came away with a respectable three goals and 15 assists that highlighted his attacking credentials. He helped lead the North German club to the 2009 DFB-Pokal with the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Bayer Leverkusen in Berlin. He also excelled in Europe where he led Werder Bremen to the final of the last ever UEFA Cup, losing out to Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine.\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, \u00d6zil became the key playmaker of Werder Bremen, stepping into the shoes of Brazilian Diego who had left for Juventus, was named the best player of the first leg of the 2009 Bundesliga season. On 1 May 2010, the 33rd match day, \u00d6zil played his 100th Bundesliga game, scoring the 1\u20130 lead in a 2\u20130 win against his former club Schalke. \u00d6zil went on and led Werder Bremen to become third in the league and again to the DFB-Pokal final, however this time it was lost against Bayern Munich by 0\u20134\\. In his second season, Bremen finished a respectable third, with \u00d6zil contributing 9 goals and 17 assists in 31 league fixture appearances. During the 2009\u201310 season, \u00d6zil was also declared as the \"best player of the first half of the season\".\n\n### Real Madrid\n\nDue to his performances in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, \u00d6zil ensured his place among Europe's top young talents. He was sought by teams like Barcelona, Arsenal and Real Madrid. English striker Wayne Rooney was one of the many admirers \u00d6zil had garnered with his performances in the World Cup, and had even asked Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to sign the German playmaker. There were reports claiming that a deal was struck for a transfer to Barcelona, but Werder Bremen denied the reports and on 17 August 2010, the team announced that they had reached an agreement with Real Madrid for \u00d6zil's transfer. The transfer fee is believed to have been in the region of \u20ac15 million. Upon signing, \u00d6zil said, \"When the offer came in to join Real Madrid, there is no decision to make. Let's be honest \u2013 you don't refuse this club. I was in no rush to leave Werder Bremen, but this is one club you say yes to. They are an institution, a club with a fantastic history, stadium and squad full of world-class players. The prospect of performing at the Bernab\u00e9u is so awesome you jump straight in.\"\n\n\u00d6zil made his debut on 22 August in a friendly match against H\u00e9rcules, which Real Madrid won 3\u20131\\. His jersey numbers were changed often before the season started. He was given the number 26 in the pre-season and 19 for his debut. But following the transfer of Rafael van der Vaart to Tottenham Hotspur, he was given the vacant 23\\.\\[*citation needed*]\n\n\u00d6zil was brought in to back up teammate Kak\u00e1, but due to the latter's surgery, \u00d6zil obtained a starting role. He then made his La Liga debut for Real Madrid as a substitute for \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda in the 62nd minute against Mallorca, which Real Madrid drew 0\u20130\\.\n\nHe made his season debut in the Champions League on 15 September. He got his first assist with Real Madrid in the 74th minute against Ajax after he crossed for a Gonzalo Higua\u00edn goal.\n\nHe walked off the pitch as a second-half substitute to standing ovations in his first two games as a starter at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. His first goal came in a league match against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a on 3 October 2010, in a 6\u20131 victory. \u00d6zil's first Champions League goal with Real came in the 14th minute against Milan on 19 October 2010\\. On 22 December, he made his debut in the Copa del Rey, scoring once in an 8\u20130 victory over Levante.\n\nHe finished the season with 25 assists, the highest for any player in any major European competition that season. \u00d6zil's performances for Real Madrid during his first season were praised by media, fans and players.\n\n\u00d6zil began wearing the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid in 2011\u201312, signalling manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's intent to use the German international as his main playmaker. On 14 August 2011, \u00d6zil scored his first goal against Barcelona in *El Cl\u00e1sico* in the first leg of the 2011 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a. On 17 August 2011, he was sent off in the last minute of the second leg of the 2011 Supercopa after an altercation with Bar\u00e7a forward David Villa. \u00d6zil expressed his desire to end his football days at the club in an interview with German magazine *kicker*, saying, \"I'd like to end my career at Real Madrid. I know it will be difficult because I have many more years ahead of me and many younger and good players will also be out there, but I want to be part of that future. I know what I'm capable of, and I'm convinced, I'll stay at Real Madrid many years.\"\n\n\u00d6zil was on the short-list of the FIFA Ballon d'Or award.\n\nHe finished atop the La Liga assists chart, with 17 assists. On 2 May 2012, he helped Real Madrid to clinch a record 32nd La Liga title as he assisted Real's first goal and scored the second goal against Bilbao, which Real Madrid later won by 3\u20130\\. Eleven days later, \u00d6zil scored two goals in the final game of the regular season against Mallorca, once again consolidating his excellent performance with the club. The win made Real the first club in the Spanish top flight to ever reach 100 points in a single season. His fine form with Real Madrid and German national team saw him earn nomination for UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, in which he finished tenth, being the youngest player to feature in the Top 10\\.\n\nWith arrival of Luka Modri\u0107 before the start of the season, some in the media claimed \u00d6zil was unhappy at Real Madrid, but he later rejected such talk and claimed he was happy at the club and looking forward to competing for his place. After the start of the season, he added the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a title to his honours. In league play, he provided an important assist to Cristiano Ronaldo who equalised in a 2\u20132 draw against Barcelona at Camp Nou. On 6 November, \u00d6zil scored a crucial 89th-minute free-kick to rescue a draw for Real Madrid and secure a point against Borussia Dortmund. He continued his fine form in the league as he scored another brace against Real Valladolid to rescue Real Madrid in a 3\u20132 win. He then went on to finish the season with 29 assists, although Real Madrid did not win any silverware except for the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, \u00d6zil's performance was praised. At the end of the season, \u00d6zil had 26 assists, more than any other player in the leagues.\\[*citation needed*]\n\n### Arsenal\n\nOn 2 September 2013, \u00d6zil agreed to join English side Arsenal. Both the fee paid for \u00d6zil as well as the contract duration were undisclosed, but they are believed to be around \u00a342\\.5 million (\u20ac50 million) for a five-year deal. The transfer makes him the most expensive German football player of all time. \u00d6zil was assigned the number 11 shirt and the centre-attacking midfield role by the team.\nContract leaks in January 2016, however, have revealed that the record fee was actually broken down to \u00a337\\.4 million (\u20ac44 million) with a further \u00a35\\.1 million (\u20ac6 million) split evenly over six years from July 2014, subject to Champions League qualification. A buy-back option also allows Real Madrid a 48-hour first option on \u00d6zil should Arsenal agree a sale for the playmaker to another Spanish club.\n\n\u00d6zil said of the transfer, \"At the weekend, I was certain I would stay at Real Madrid but afterwards I realised I did not have the faith from the coach or the bosses. I am a player who needs this faith and that is what I have felt from Arsenal, which is why I have joined.\" In \u00d6zil's first press conference, he said: \"I would have come here for free, that wouldn't have been a problem.\" \u00d6zil additionally stated that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger played an important role in his decision: \"When I spoke to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger on the phone, he was full of respect, and as a player, I need that.\" Several Real Madrid players were dissatisfied with \u00d6zil leaving the club, including Cristiano Ronaldo, who said, \"He was the player who best knew my moves in front of goal ... I'm angry about \u00d6zil leaving.\"\n\n\u00d6zil made his debut for Arsenal in their league game away to Sunderland on 14 September 2013\\. He assisted Olivier Giroud's goal in the 11th minute of the match as they went on to win 3\u20131\\. Three days after that, he made his Champions League debut for Arsenal against Marseille. Just over three weeks after making his debut for Arsenal, he made his home debut against Stoke City in a 3\u20131 victory. He was involved in all three goals, with two assists and a free kick which was saved but fell into Aaron Ramsey's path. He scored his first goal for Arsenal, a brilliantly controlled finish from a Ramsey cross, in a 2\u20130 win against Napoli in the Champions League. On 19 October, he scored his first two Premier League goals during the 4\u20131 home win against Norwich City. \u00d6zil played in all six of Arsenal's games in November. The German playmaker provided the cross for Jack Wilshere's second goal against Marseille and gave further assists for Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini in the 3\u20130 win over Cardiff City. \u00d6zil missed the chance to score his fourth Arsenal goal when he saw his penalty in the win over Marseille saved by Steve Mandanda.\n\nIn October, \u00d6zil was again short-listed for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award, along with former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. \u00d6zil was also featured on the UEFA Team of the Year. \u00d6zil began December with two goals in as many games against Hull City and Everton. A minor shoulder injury forced him out of the final game of December in a win against Newcastle United. After the 6\u20133 defeat at Manchester City in which he made another assist, \u00d6zil was involved in an altercation with teammate Per Mertesacker, who was angry with \u00d6zil's failure to thank the travelling supporters, an omission for which he subsequently apologised via Facebook.\n\n\u00d6zil started four of Arsenal's six games in January. The playmaker missed Arsenal's victory over Cardiff City on New Year's Day with a shoulder injury before returning to make a late appearance from the bench against Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup. The 25-year-old produced a slide-rule pass for Lukas Podolski to score his first goal against Coventry City and provided the ball for Santi Cazorla's goal against Southampton at the end of the month to take his assist tally to 10\\.\n\nFebruary was a difficult month for \u00d6zil, as he struggled to reach the heights he showed in his first few months at the club. The German playmaker pulled off a brilliant piece of skill to win a penalty against Bayern Munich in the Champions League knockout phase, but his spot-kick was saved by Manuel Neuer. Speaking before the draw with Manchester United, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger spoke about \u00d6zil, saying, \"He has done well, he is adapting as well to the Premier League \u2013 we have seen it before \\[that it takes time]. I wouldn't like to put too much pressure on him because he has been a top-class player until now. He didn't have the best of games \\[at Liverpool] (a 5\u20131 loss, where \u00d6zil was the centre of attention due to a bad performance) but that can happen. He works very hard to adapt to the physical level of the Premier League and for me he is an exceptional player.\"\n\nOn 8 March, \u00d6zil scored his first goal of 2014 in a 4\u20131 FA Cup quarter-final win over Everton. \u00d6zil was showing signs of old form and started in Arsenal's second leg Champions League last 16 clash with Bayern Munich. He was substituted at half-time, and the reasoning behind it was that \u00d6zil had suffered a hamstring injury and will face a month out, missing key fixtures against Chelsea and Manchester City.\n\nOn 20 April, \u00d6zil made an instant impact with a lively display against Hull when he returned to the Arsenal team in a 3\u20130 win. He then returned to goalscoring form with Arsenal's second in their 3\u20130 win over Newcastle United, and then assisted Olivier Giroud's header. Manager Wenger praised \u00d6zil's impact upon his return, saying, \"Mesut \u00d6zil is very important for the team. He's been missed while he's been injured. We've missed some very important players in an important period of the season. We're really pleased to have people like him back in the team and performing at the top level because that's what we need.\"\n\n\u00d6zil played all three of Arsenal's remaining fixtures during the last month of his debut season in England. The German playmaker came off at half-time in extra-time of Arsenal's 2014 FA Cup Final victory over Hull at Wembley Stadium. Speaking before the FA Cup final, Per Mertesacker praised his compatriot's impact on the side during his first season in England. \"You could see from the start that he is one of the best players in Europe\", said Mertesacker. \"His contributions and assists are vital for any club so we are happy to have him back.\" \u00d6zil completed his maiden season at Arsenal with 13 assists and seven goals in all competitions spanning a course of 40 games.\n\n\u00d6zil returned to club training in the middle of August after participating in Germany's 2014 FIFA World Cup win in Brazil. On 23 August, \u00d6zil made his first appearance of the season in a 2\u20132 draw with Everton at Goodison Park. On 27 August, he played a part in Alexis S\u00e1nchez's winning goal in the second leg of the Champions League qualification play-off against Be\u015fikta\u015f, playing a one-two with Jack Wilshere in the build-up to the goal. On 20 September, \u00d6zil opened the scoring and assisted Danny Welbeck in a 3\u20130 victory against Aston Villa at Villa Park. \u00d6zil featured in the three following games and started in Arsenal's Champions League group stage victory against Galatasaray, providing an assist for Alexis S\u00e1nchez in a 4\u20131 win. On 8 October, the DFB declared that \u00d6zil would be sidelined for between 10 and 12 weeks with a left knee injury obtained during a 2\u20130 defeat at Chelsea three days prior to the international break. The prognosis would rule him out of the remainder of Arsenal's Champions League group matches, as well as four international fixtures.\n\nOn 11 January 2015, \u00d6zil made his first appearance in three months as a 73rd-minute substitute in a 3\u20130 win against Stoke City. He scored on his return to the starting line-up in Arsenal's 3\u20132 win at Brighton \\& Hove Albion in the fourth round of the FA Cup on 25 January, latching onto a pass from Tom\u00e1\u0161 Rosick\u00fd before scoring Arsenal's second goal. In his first Premier League start of the year, \u00d6zil scored once and provided an assist for Olivier Giroud as Arsenal beat Aston Villa 5\u20130 at home on 1 February. The following week, \u00d6zil scored the opening goal in the Gunners' 2\u20131 North London derby defeat to Tottenham at White Hart Lane. He continued his good form by creating both goals in a 2\u20131 victory over Leicester City on 10 February. He also grabbed a pair of assists two weeks later, in a 2\u20130 victory against Everton. On 4 April, he scored the second goal for his team in a 4\u20131 win over Liverpool, which would be his final goal of the season. After a 3\u20131 win over Hull, manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger praised him by saying, \"Overall his influence was very strong.\"\n\n\u00d6zil followed up this goal with two assists for Alexis S\u00e1nchez in a 2\u20131 win against Reading in the 2014\u201315 FA Cup semi-final on 18 April. \u00d6zil started in the 2015 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Aston Villa in a commanding 4\u20130 victory on 30 May, concluding his second season at Arsenal with 5 goals and 9 assists, in 33 appearances across all competitions, and back-to-back FA Cups.\n\nAfter scoring during a pre-season game against Lyon, \u00d6zil received praise from his manager, with Wenger calling for him to have his best season yet in Arsenal colours. On 2 August 2015, \u00d6zil started for Arsenal in the 2015 FA Community Shield, where the Gunners beat league champions Chelsea 1\u20130 at Wembley Stadium. A week later, he made his first appearance of the Premier League season in Arsenal's 2\u20130 opening day defeat to West Ham United.\n\n\u00d6zil scored his first goal of the 2015\u201316 season in a 3\u20130 home victory over Manchester United on 4 October. He had earlier assisted Alexis S\u00e1nchez to give the Gunners the lead in the sixth minute of the match. \u00d6zil was named man of the match in a 3\u20130 win at Watford's Vicarage Road on 17 October, supplying assists for S\u00e1nchez and Olivier Giroud. On 20 October, \u00d6zil scored his first Champions League goal of the season in Arsenal's 2\u20130 group stage home win over Bayern Munich.\n\nHe set a new Premier League record being the first player to assist in six consecutive matches when setting up Kieran Gibbs' for 1\u20131 in the derby versus Tottenham on 8 November 2015\\. He then extended that run to seven straight games with an assist against West Bromwich Albion, before scoring his second Champions League goal of the season in a three-goal victory at home to Dinamo Zagreb. He then scored for the second game in a row when he clipped in the opener in a 1\u20131 draw at Norwich. \u00d6zil continued his run of good form by providing four assists in the next three games, against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Sunderland, helping his team win all three matches. On 28 December 2015, \u00d6zil assisted the first goal and scored the second in a 2\u20130 win against AFC Bournemouth, creating nine scoring chances in total \u2013 the most in a single Premier League game by any player during the season.\n\nOn 24 January 2016, \u00d6zil played his 100th game for the Gunners in a 1\u20130 home defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League. The next Premier League game against Southampton at home on 2 February saw \u00d6zil creating 10 chances \u2013 beating the previous record, 9 created and held by him during the season. This proved in vain, however, as the match ended 0\u20130 with the Gunners slumping into fourth as they failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games. He then ended the Gunners' barren goal-scoring run in the Premier League with the opener against Bournemouth in a 2\u20130 away win on 7 February. \u00d6zil delivered his 17th assist in the Premier League from a free kick for Danny Welbeck to head in the winner deep into stoppage time as Arsenal came from behind to beat league leaders Leicester City 2\u20131 on 14 February.\n\nAfter a 2\u20130 home defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, \u00d6zil scored and assisted in a 3\u20132 defeat at Old Trafford to Manchester United as the Gunners lost further ground in the title race. \u00d6zil started in the 2\u20131 Watford in the FA Cup, where he set up Danny Welbeck for Arsenal's consolation goal with a backheel assist, and three days later in a 3\u20131 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League as Arsenal crashed out in successive cup competitions in March.\n\n\u00d6zil assisted Olivier Giroud's second goal in Arsenal's last Premier League match of the season against Aston Villa in a 4\u20130 home victory as the Gunners finished second ahead of fierce rivals, Tottenham Hotspur. That was \u00d6zil's 19th assist of the season in the league, a record only beaten by Thierry Henry with 20 in 2002\u201303 in Premier League history. \u00d6zil ended his third season at Arsenal with 8 goals and 20 assists in all club competitions, which won him the Arsenal Player of the Season award.\n\n\u00d6zil missed Arsenal's opening day defeat to Liverpool, after his excursions at UEFA Euro 2016 meant he was not match-fit. However, he started his first game of the new season for his club in a 1\u20133 away win at Watford on 28 August, in which he scored his first goal of the campaign, heading in an Alexis S\u00e1nchez cross to score Arsenal's third of the afternoon. His second arrived just under a month later, netting a controlled volley in a 3\u20130 home win against Chelsea. On 15 October, \u00d6zil again scored a volley at home, as he recorded the decider in a tense 3\u20132 win against Swansea. Four days later, in a Champions League home game against Ludogorets Razgrad, \u00d6zil assisted Theo Walcott's goal, and scored his first professional career hat-trick, which was concluded after again volleying as Arsenal went on to win 6\u20130\\. On 29 October, he registered his first league assist of the season, after Giroud latched onto a corner to score the club's third in a 1\u20134 win against Sunderland. For his performances, he was awarded the club's Player of the Month award for the month of October.\\[*citation needed*]\n\n\u00d6zil began November by recording his third assist, which came in the North London derby, and was given after his free kick was turned into the net by opposing defender Kevin Wimmer. \u00d6zil would then record Arsenal's Goal of the Season on 19 October, as he scored a remarkable solo winner in a nervy 2\u20133 away win against Ludogorets, which capped a resilient comeback after Arsenal were down by two goals in the opening 15 minutes. He scored the opener in a 1\u20135 away win against West Ham United on 3 December, and assisted the fourth goal. He repeated his set-up exploits three days later in a Champions League win against Basel, feeding Iwobi from the left for the fourth. He then scored a header in a win against Stoke City a week later, before rounding out the year, \u00d6zil assisted the only goal in a home victory against West Brom on 26 December. He registered his first assist of 2017 after placing his corner directly in the path of teammate Mustafi, who headed past Tom Heaton in a 2\u20131 win against Burnley. Despite an impressive first half to the campaign, \u00d6zil would then struggle with muscular problems, and was absent for a number of Arsenal's games.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nHe returned to fitness to star in a 2\u20132 draw against Manchester City on 2 April, where he assisted the equaliser. He would also break his four-month cold goalless spell after placing a controlled finish in a 3\u20130 win against West Ham United three days later, while he also assisted the second. He then scored another volley just under two weeks later, in a win against Middlesbrough. He then recorded his ninth assist on 10 May, where he set up S\u00e1nchez's opener. In the last three league gameweeks, he scored his final goal of the season against Stoke City, while his final two assists arrived in the following two weeks, against both Sunderland and Everton. Despite the club missing out on the league and Champions League qualification, \u00d6zil concluded his fourth season at the club with 12 goals and 13 assists in 44 appearances across all competitions, and featured heavily as he won the 2017 FA Cup.\\[*citation needed*]\n\n\u00d6zil entered the 2017\u201318 season in the final year of his contract, and struggled initially, featuring sparsely with knee inflammation. He recorded a goal and an assist in a 5\u20132 victory over Everton on 22 October, and recorded another assist a week later, against Swansea City. His performance in the North London Derby on 18 November was heavily praised, after creating the first goal. He then scored and assisted twice in a 5\u20130 victory over Huddersfield to close out November, and scored in back-to-back weeks to close out December, first in a victory against West Ham, and then a scintillating scooped finish in a 3\u20133 draw against Liverpool.\n\nAfter entering January with six months remaining on his contract, which would allow him to engage in pre-contract negotiations with any club, \u00d6zil assisted in a win over Crystal Palace, and also assisted in a loss in the reverse fixture against Swansea City on 30 January. A day later, he re-signed with the club on a three-year extension, keeping him contracted until 2021\\. It was also reported his salary more than doubled to \u00a3350,000 per week, making him the highest-paid player in Arsenal's history.\n\nOn 15 February, \u00d6zil scored in the first knockout round of the Europa League, netting calmly against \u00d6stersund. He then gained a brace of assists in the next round, against Milan. On 11 March, he recorded his 50th Premier League assist in a 3\u20130 win over Watford. In doing so, he became the fastest player to reach 50 assists in the competition, in his 141st appearance, breaking the record previously held by Eric Cantona. He continued his exploits in the Europa League by recording a hat-trick of assists in a victory against CSKA Moscow on 5 April. Persistent injuries limited his involvement in the club's final games of the season, however, \u00d6zil ended his fifth season at Arsenal with 5 goals and 13 assists in 35 appearances, and featured heavily in the club's later run and appearance in the 2018 EFL Cup Final.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nFollowing the departure of Jack Wilshere, \u00d6zil returned to wearing the number 10, for the 2018\u201319 season. He was also named one of Arsenal's vice-captains. \u00d6zil scored his first goal of the season in Arsenal's 2\u20131 away win over Newcastle on 15 September, and netted again a week later in a 4\u20132 victory in the UEFA Europa League over Vorskla Poltava. He scored his third goal of the season in a victory over Watford on 28 September. On 22 October, he captained Arsenal for the first time in a 3\u20131 comeback win over Leicester City. \u00d6zil was involved in all three goals, scoring the first, and adding two assists in a man-of-the-match performance.\n\nHis involvement in the first-team began to falter due to a mix of injuries and a dip in form, but he returned to assist the only goal in a victory in the Europa League against Qarabag on 12 December. \u00d6zil was also publicly left out of the first team squad on a few occasions, leading to speculation he could depart Arsenal in the January transfer window. However, no move materialised, and his form continued to suffer, with rumours also circulating of \u00d6zil having a fractured relationship with head coach Unai Emery, who publicly questioned the player's motivation. He returned to goalscoring form in a 5\u20131 home victory against Bournemouth, where he also registered an assist, on 27 February, while his last statistical contribution came in the form of a goal in a loss against Crystal Palace in April. As a result, he registered one of his worst statistical campaigns as an Arsenal player, netting six goals and providing four assists.\\[*citation needed*]\n\nDespite this, \u00d6zil featured in the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final, where, after Arsenal's defeat, \u00d6zil reportedly vocalised his frustration with Emery in front of his teammates, and continued to be linked with a move away from north London.\n\n\u00d6zil was given additional time off to start the 2019\u201320 season, after being the victim of an attempted robbery. He made his season debut on 15 September, in a 2\u20132 draw against Watford. He was controversially left out of the following Premier League games against Aston Villa and Manchester United, and registered his second appearance of the season in an EFL Cup tie against Nottingham Forest, where he again failed to complete 90 minutes. \u00d6zil made his third appearance of the season in an EFL Cup tie defeat against Liverpool in October. He registered his first assist against Liverpool in the same competition at the end of October, and subsequently returning to the league starting lineup for November; he registered his first league assist in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Brighton \\& Hove Albion in December.\n\n\u00d6zil only completed 90 minutes once more in the league for the remainder of the campaign, scoring his first goal of the season in a 4\u20130 victory over Newcastle United on 16 February 2020\\. He registered his second league assist against West Ham United on 7 March, but did not feature for the club again following the resumption of competitive football after its suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, \u00d6zil registered his worst statistical season, as well making the lowest number of appearances in a campaign since the 2007\u201308 season. It was also reported \u00d6zil refused a voluntary 12\\.5% paycut amid the pandemic, doing so as the club \"\\[lacked] information and \\[left] many questions unanswered\" over their use of these wages.\n\n\u00d6zil was left out of the match-day squads for the first matches of the 2020\u201321 season and was not included in the club's squad for the Europa League group stage. It was also later confirmed that \u00d6zil was omitted from Arsenal's 25-man Premier League squad, leaving him eligible only to play for Arsenal's U-23 squad. \u00d6zil released a statement on Twitter in which he said that he was \"deeply disappointed\" but would \"continue fighting for \\[his] chance\". Some had suggested \u00d6zil's omission from the squad was related to his criticism of the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China, from which Arsenal publicly distanced themselves.\n\n### Fenerbah\u00e7e\n\n\"I am very excited because I was always a fan of Fenerbah\u00e7e. A dream has come true for me. That's why I'm very excited to wear the jersey. I hope I will be successful with my teammates. I hope everything will be fine. I wish the best.\"\n\nOn 27 January 2021, \u00d6zil moved to Turkish club Fenerbah\u00e7e. He joined as a free agent after his contract with Arsenal was terminated six months prematurely, with the player reportedly forgoing part of the \u00a37 million (\u20ac7\\.9 million) owed to him by Arsenal. Although financial terms were undisclosed, \u00d6zil signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Fenerbah\u00e7e worth a reported \u00a34\\.5 million (\u20ac5 million) a season, and received a \u00a32\\.6 million (\u20ac3 million) signing-on bonus.\n\n\u00d6zil said he was \"very excited\" to be joining the club and would \"wear the shirt with pride\". Fenerbah\u00e7e had wanted to sign \u00d6zil for years, and chairman Ali Ko\u00e7 also commended the deal, noting they were unable to sign the player in 2019 due to financial concerns. \u00d6zil had stated a desire to represent Fenerbah\u00e7e, the team he supported as a child during his career, as well as play in Major League Soccer (MLS), with \u00d6zil also engaging in negotiations with D.C. United prior to signing for Fenerbah\u00e7e.\n\nIn his first season, \u00d6zil was assigned the number 67 jersey, in reference to the license plate of his ancestral town, Zonguldak, as his recognizable number 10, as well as his previous number 11, were occupied by Mbwana Samatta and Diego Perotti, respectively. On 2 February, he made his S\u00fcper Lig debut for Fenerbah\u00e7e as a substitute for Mame Thiam in the 77th minute against Hatayspor, which Fenerbah\u00e7e won 2\u20131\\. \u00d6zil missed eight games in his first season, from 4 March until 29 April, after rupturing ankle ligaments and contracting COVID-19\\. He recorded his first assist for the club on 11 May in a 2\u20131 loss against Sivasspor, as Fenerbah\u00e7e eventually finished third.\n\nIn his second season, \u00d6zil was assigned the number 10 jersey, his recognizable number. On 15 August, he scored his first goal for the club in a 1\u20130 away victory against Adana Demirspor, also captaining the team for the first time. On 16 September, he scored his first European goal for Fenerbah\u00e7e in a UEFA Europa League game against Eintracht Frankfurt. On 21 November, he scored an equaliser in the 31st minute, sprinting from the halfway line to the penalty area, against Galatasaray in the Intercontinental Derby, which Fenerbah\u00e7e won 2\u20131 at Nef Stadium.\n\nOn 24 March 2022, Fenerbah\u00e7e announced that he was excluded from squad, along with his teammate Ozan Tufan. \u00d6zil completed his second season at Fenerbah\u00e7e with 9 goals and 2 assists in 26 games in all competitions. On 13 July, his contract with Fenerbah\u00e7e was mutually terminated.\n\n### \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir and retirement\n\nOn 14 July 2022, \u00d6zil signed a one-year contract with an option for an additional year with \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir. On 21 August 2022, he made his debut for \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir in a S\u00fcper Lig game against Kayserispor, as a substitute for Berkay \u00d6zcan in the 80th minute, which \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir won 2\u20130\\.\n\n\u00d6zil left the club and announced his retirement from professional football on 22 March 2023, citing recurrent injuries. \u00d6zil made 427 top-flight appearances in his club career.\n\nInternational career\n--------------------\n\nEligible to play for either Germany or Turkey, after long consideration, \u00d6zil chose to play for his country of birth, Germany. In September 2006, he was called up for the Germany under-17 team. He was a member of the German under-21 team from 2007\\. On 29 June 2009, \u00d6zil was selected the man of the match in a 4\u20130 win over England during the U-21 European Championship final.\n\nHe made his debut for the senior side during a friendly match against Norway on 11 February 2009\\. He scored his first goal for the senior team in his third appearance, another friendly, against South Africa on 5 September in Leverkusen at the BayArena.\n\n### 2010 FIFA World Cup\n\n\u00d6zil was selected for Germany's squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, starting in all of the team's matches. He provided an assist for Cacau's goal to the 4\u20130 final score against Australia in Germany's first group game. He scored a left-footed half-volley from the edge of the penalty area against Ghana in the final group game, ensuring Germany progressed to the second round as group winners.\n\nOn 27 June 2010, \u00d6zil played in Germany's win over England in the last 16 match, setting up the fourth goal with a cross to Thomas M\u00fcller as Germany triumphed 4\u20131\\. During the quarter-final match against Argentina, he assisted the second goal for Miroslav Klose with a cross to ensure the 4\u20130 final score for the Germans. FIFA announced that he was among the ten tournament players nominated for the Golden Ball.\n\n### UEFA Euro 2012\n\n\u00d6zil was one of the leading forces in Germany's qualification for UEFA Euro 2012, scoring five times during the campaign as Germany won all ten of its games to top their group. \u00d6zil also confirmed his reputation as a decisive passer, as he provided seven assists, more than any European international during Euro 2012 qualification. When asked about his country's chances at Euro 2012, \u00d6zil simply replied, \"We have the potential to beat anyone and we have what it takes to win the title.\"\n\nOn 29 February 2012, \u00d6zil was recognised as Germany's best international of the year for 2011 prior to kick-off at a friendly against France in Bremen. \u00d6zil's Germany were drawn with the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal into Group B at Euro 2012, widely touted as the \"Group of Death\".\n\n\u00d6zil registered two assists, created nine chances, and claimed the Man of the Match award in Germany's 4\u20132 quarter-final win over Greece. He then scored Germany's only goal (a penalty) in their 2\u20131 loss to Italy in the semi-finals. His performance at Euro 2012 earned him two Carlsberg Man of the Match Awards. He finished the tournament as the joint-highest assist provider (3\\) and was named in the Team of the Tournament.\n\n### 2014 FIFA World Cup\n\n\u00d6zil ended the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign as Germany's top scorer with eight goals.\n\nFollowing an injury to Marco Reus in a warm-up game, \u00d6zil was moved from his customary number 10 role into the left-winger position for the majority of the tournament. He started all seven of Germany's 2014 FIFA World Cup games, and helped Germany make history by becoming the first European team to win the World Cup in South America. \u00d6zil scored the decisive goal in the 119th minute of Germany's 2\u20131 round of 16 victory over Algeria, a match widely praised as one of the most entertaining of the tournament. \u00d6zil then provided an assist for Sami Khedira in Germany's 7\u20131 semi-final win over Brazil. The goal \u00d6zil assisted, with a clever pass, made the score 5\u20130 to Germany after just 29 minutes. The shocking nature of the 5-goal flurry generated worldwide astonishment.\n\nIn the final, \u00d6zil played 120 minutes before being replaced by Arsenal teammate Per Mertesacker. Germany were crowned World Champions with a 1\u20130 win. After the trophy was presented to the Germany team, UEFA President Michel Platini asked \u00d6zil for his match shirt as a souvenir, and \u00d6zil obliged. He concluded the tournament as the leader in passes completed in the final-third (171\\), was ranked joint-second in chances created (17\\), behind only Lionel Messi (23\\), and ranked second overall in possessions won in the final-third (6\\).\n\n### UEFA Euro 2016\n\nOn 12 June 2016, \u00d6zil completed the full 90 minutes of Germany's opening Euro 2016 match against Ukraine which Germany won 2\u20130\\. He assisted Bastian Schweinsteiger's goal in the 92nd minute. On 21 June 2016, \u00d6zil completed 99% of his passes, created six chances and claimed the Man of the Match award in Germany's win over Northern Ireland. Five days later, \u00d6zil started in Germany's 3\u20130 round of 16 win over Slovakia. In the 13th minute of the match, he had a penalty effort saved by goalkeeper Mat\u00fa\u0161 Koz\u00e1\u010dik. On 2 July 2016, \u00d6zil scored the leading goal against Italy in the quarter-finals to give Germany a 1\u20130 advantage, before Italy later equalised through Leonardo Bonucci's penalty. Germany, however, emerged as the victorious side after winning the penalty shoot-out 6\u20135, despite \u00d6zil failing to convert his penalty kick after hitting the goal post.\n\n### 2018 FIFA World Cup\n\n\u00d6zil was selected by manager Joachim L\u00f6w in Germany's final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Despite the national team heavily under-performing as defending champions by being eliminated in the group stages, \u00d6zil featured in two of the country's three games, and averaged more chances created per 90 minutes (5\\.5\\) than any other player in the competition.\n\n### Retirement\n\nIn May 2018, \u00d6zil, alongside fellow German international \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, both of Turkish descent, met with and posed for photographs with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in the lead up to the Turkish general election. The photograph was interpreted as a form of political support for Erdo\u011fan and his policies, and caused tensions in Germany, and even prompted accusations that the players lacked loyalty to the German nation. The German Football Association (DFB) publicly distanced themselves from public criticism, opting to end the debate, and focus on the upcoming World Cup campaign, in which both \u00d6zil and G\u00fcndo\u011fan participated.\n\nAfter the nation's World Cup campaign, losing out at the group stage, \u00d6zil posted a series of messages on social media on 22 July, in order to clarify the photograph and address the criticisms he had faced. In a lengthy post, he described the photograph as simply \"respecting the highest office of my family's country\", while also adding his conversations with Erdo\u011fan revolved solely around their mutual interest in football. \u00d6zil also commented on several media outlets that were using the photograph, where he asserted that the media outlets have selectively criticised him for his Turkish background, noting the relative lack of uproar from the media after Lothar Matth\u00e4us met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe later detailed his core issue with the national team stemmed from his interactions with Reinhard Grindel, the DFB president, accusing him of displaying both racism and disrespect on multiple occasions, while also noting similar incidents with other high-profile German nationals, namely Bernd Holzhauer and Werner Steer. He then retired from the team as a form of protest against members within the Federation in which he perceived had \"racially discriminative backgrounds\". Following the announcement of his retirement, \u00d6zil drew support and criticism from the public, former players, and managers; former teammate Per Mertesacker came out in support. Toni Kroos was critical of \u00d6zil's statement and responded by saying that \"racism within the national team and the DFB does not exist\". In a 2018 interview with Germany's biggest newspaper Bild am Sonntag, former DFB president Reinhard Grindel said he wished he had stood by \u00d6zil in the face of racial abuse. In the years following his retirement, some media outlets continued to highlight how \u00d6zil was a victim of the deep rooted racism present in German society. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the German national team covered their mouths prior to kickoff in protest of FIFAs decision to ban the OneLove armband; with the DFB explaining that the protest was meant to uphold values of diversity and mutual respect. They were subsequently criticized and labelled by some as moral hypocrites for previously ignoring and/or failing to uphold values of diversity and mutual respect when \u00d6zil was subjected to racial abuse in Germany.\n\nPlayer profile\n--------------\n\n### Style of play\n\nA quick, agile, creative and technical player, with good dribbling skills, \u00d6zil was a versatile midfielder, who excelled in an advanced playmaking role, as a winger on either flank, or as an attacking midfielder through the centre of the pitch. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he was also deployed in a new role which was later described as a false 10 or central winger, due to his tendency to drift from the centre into a wide position when in possession of the ball; he was also deployed in a more advanced role, where he usually functioned as a second striker, as he often dropped into deeper positions, from which he could link the midfield with the attack and initiate passing moves. He even played as a centre-forward on occasion, seemingly operating as a lone striker, but actually operating false 9 role. An elegant left-footed player, his main attributes were his vision, his control, movement (both on and off the ball), positional sense, finesse, passing range, and accurate crossing ability, as well as his delivery from set-pieces, which allowed him to get into good attacking positions, create chances, and provide many assists for his teammates, or even score goals himself.\n\nDue to his creative ability and offensive prowess as a playmaker, \u00d6zil was called \"assist-king\" in the media. As of January 2016, \u00d6zil had the best ratio of assists per game in the history of the Premier League.\\[*non-primary source needed*] Germany under-21 manager Horst Hrubesch once said, \"We in Germany are prone to rave about foreign players. We praise Wayne Rooney to the heavens, likewise Ronaldo or Messi. But we have our own Messi. Our Messi is \u00d6zil.\" In the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Belgium, he scored a goal which has been described as a \"work of art\". Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w hails \u00d6zil for his \"genius moments\" and his performance without the ball.\n\n### Reception\n\nFormer Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso described \u00d6zil as \"the kind of player you don't find these days\", adding, \"He understands the game, sees things, combines and thrives between the lines, unlocking teams.\" Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who coached \u00d6zil for a time at Real Madrid said, \"\u00d6zil is unique. There is no copy of him \u2013 not even a bad copy.\" Assistant coach of the Germany national team Hansi Flick said, \"We are proud to have him in our team. When he has the ball, you can feel the excitement and astonishment among the fans.\" Former Netherlands and Milan forward Ruud Gullit described \u00d6zil as a \"technically perfect\" player who has \"total control of the ball\" and a \"great imagination\". Former Germany teammate Phillip Lahm said of \u00d6zil \"His vision is probably the best I have ever seen... He is a dream for strikers.\", while Mario G\u00f3mez called \u00d6zil \"probably the most brilliant footballer we have or ever had\". Despite his reputation as an offensive playmaker, \u00d6zil also drew criticism at times for his lack of physicality and his low defensive work-rate off the ball. Despite his success, he was also accused by some in the sport, including Glenn Hoddle, Raymond Domenech and Jonathan Smith, of going missing in important or physical games.\n\nHis nicknames have included \"*der Rabe*\" (the Raven, or in Spanish, \"*El Cuervo*\") \u2013 playing on his smart and opportunistic style of play, and at Werder Bremen \"*der neue Diego*\" (the new Diego), in reference to Brazilian Diego, whose playmaker role he inherited, \"German Messi\" and \"German Zidane\". At Real Madrid, he was supposedly called \"Nemo\", due to his physical appearance \u2013 in reference to the clownfish from the animated film *Finding Nemo*.\n\nOutside football\n----------------\n\n### Personal life\n\n\u00d6zil is a third-generation Turkish-German, who, in reference to his game, concludes, \"My technique and feeling for the ball is the Turkish side to my game. The discipline, attitude and always-give-your-all is the German part.\" The first language \u00d6zil learned was Turkish. Instead of a regular kindergarten, he attended a special preschool *(Vorbereitungsschule)* populated exclusively with children of immigrants, mostly Turkish. \u00d6zil later said this actually greatly hindered his acquisition of German, as the children would speak German exclusively with the teacher and only Turkish for the rest of the time, saying in 2017: \"even today, I need to concentrate when speaking German\". He later attended school at Gesamtschule Berger Feld in Gelsenkirchen. \u00d6zil states his ancestors are ethnic Turks from Devrek. However, there are sources that claim \u00d6zil's ancestors are ethnic Kurds. Despite being born and raised in Germany, \u00d6zil only held Turkish citizenship until the age of 19, when he renounced it in order to naturalize as a German citizen, as Germany generally did not tolerate dual citizenship until 2024, particularly for Turkish citizens.\n\n\u00d6zil is a practising Muslim. He recites from the Quran before his matches. Talking to the Berlin-based daily *Der Tagesspiegel*, \u00d6zil said, \"I always do that before I go out \\[on the pitch]. I pray and my teammates know that they cannot talk to me during this brief period.\" He observes fasting during the Islamic month of Ramadan, but he has admitted that: \"Because of my job I cannot follow Ramadan properly. I do it only the few days I can, only when I have a free day. But other than that it's impossible, because you have to drink and eat a lot to stay at peak fitness.\" In May 2016, he performed *Umrah* pilgrimage to Mecca. During a Europa League match in 2018 against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, an Atl\u00e9tico fan threw a piece of bread at \u00d6zil while he was preparing to take a corner. \u00d6zil picked up the bread, kissed it, and brought it to his forehead to express gratitude towards the food given to him, a central tenet in Islam. His gesture was later widely applauded throughout the stadium.\n\nIn 2010, \u00d6zil was awarded the Bambi for being a prime example of successful integration within German society.\n\n\u00d6zil started dating singer Mandy Capristo in 2013\\. The relationship ended in 2014, following reports of \u00d6zil being involved with another woman. In 2015, \u00d6zil and Capristo appeared together at the Bambi awards ceremony in Berlin. An Instagram photo uploaded by \u00d6zil used the hashtag \\#OziStoIsBack, suggesting that the couple is back together. However, they broke up in 2017 and \u00d6zil began dating former Miss Turkey, Amine G\u00fcl\u015fe. They married in 2019, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was a witness during the ceremony. In March 2020, the couple confirmed the birth of their first child, a daughter named Eda. Their second daughter, named Ela, was born in September 2022\\.\n\nIn July 2019, \u00d6zil and Arsenal teammate Sead Kola\u0161inac were the victims of an attempted carjacking by a pair of armed masked men. A Metropolitan Police spokesman later said \u00d6zil and Kola\u0161inac managed to get away unharmed and travelled to a nearby restaurant in Golders Green, where they were \"spoken to by officers\". Footage also circulated on social media which appeared to show Kola\u0161inac chasing off the carjackers. Arsenal commented they reviewed security measures with their players with help from independent experts and the police, which resulted in the pair not being included in Arsenal's Premier League season opener against Newcastle United on 11 August. Later the same day, two men were arrested and charged with a public order offence after becoming involved in an altercation with security staff outside \u00d6zil's home. Police noted this incident was unrelated to the car-jacking attempt.\n\n### Philanthropy\n\nAs part of the BigShoe project, \u00d6zil donated his 2014 World Cup winnings, an estimated \u00a3240,000, to pay for 23 sick Brazilian children to have medical surgery as a \"personal thank you for the hospitality of the people of Brazil.\"\n\nIn May 2016, international media covered \u00d6zil's visit to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, home to around 80,000 people displaced as a result of the Syrian civil war. \u00d6zil toured the camp as well as playing with children, signing autographs and handing out football shirts. After getting married in June 2019, \u00d6zil paid for 1,000 children to have surgery in celebration.\n\nIn 2017, he worked with the charity My Shining Star to make a child cancer patient's dreams come true. He invited the child, Charlie, to be a guest at his private box and in the player's lounge during a game with Sunderland at Emirates Stadium. In 2020, after Arsenal made longterm mascot Jerry Quy redundant, \u00d6zil offered to reimburse Arsenal for his salary if they rehired Quy, doing so due to their close friendship.\n\nIn Ramadan 2021, \u00d6zil sent food packages to 41 provinces in Turkey to people in need, in collaboration with the Turkish Red Crescent.\n\n### Activism and advocacy\n\nIn December 2019, \u00d6zil went online to publish a poem denouncing the treatment of Uyghurs in China. It was written over a backdrop of the East Turkestan flag and in it, he also criticised Muslim countries for not speaking out about the Xinjiang internment camps. Arsenal later released a statement distancing itself from the comments. State broadcasters China Central Television and PP Sports responded two days later by removing the match between Arsenal and Manchester City from their schedules, while his likeness was removed from Chinese internet providers and version of *eFootball PES 2020*. The Chinese Football Association said \u00d6zil's comments were \"unacceptable\". Some have suggested \u00d6zil's eventual omission from the Arsenal squad was related to such criticism. China's government later stated \u00d6zil was \"blinded and misled\", and invited him to visit Xinjiang.\n\nIn October 2020, he voiced his support for Azerbaijan in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, quoting Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk on the Azerbaijani\u2013Turkish relations. During his presentation as a Fenerbah\u00e7e player, he posed with the Azerbaijani flag.\n\nHe announced his support for Palestine in the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis, also wearing a \"Free Palestine\" T-shirt along with other Fenerbah\u00e7e footballers. In October 2021, \u00d6zil teamed with the Football Association (FA) and Football for Peace to launch a development center, located at the University of Bradford, to tackle the disparity of British Asians in association football. Quoting his own background, \u00d6zil stated a desire to \"give \\[British Asians] an opportunity to be successful on and off the pitch\".\n\n### Media and sponsorships\n\nIn 2013, \u00d6zil signed a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas. He has appeared in commercials for Adidas Predator boots with other star players such as Lionel Messi, Gareth Bale, Thomas M\u00fcller and James Rodr\u00edguez. One of those adverts, entitled \"Create Your Own Game\", was released in August 2015, in which \u00d6zil featured alongside those players. In 2013, \u00d6zil launched his own logo.\n\n\u00d6zil's \"M\" goal celebration \u2013 which is in tribute to his young niece Mira \u2013 is included in EA Sports' *FIFA 17*.\n\nHis autobiography, *The Magic of the Game / Gunning for Greatness*, was released in 2017\\.\n\n### Business ventures\n\n\u00d6zil has built a varied business portfolio over the years. He is the boss of his own M10 streetwear firm and esports team. Additionally he has his own chain of coffee shops, a sports clinic and he jointly runs a successful Unity Health supplements laboratory with former Arsenal teammate Mathieu Flamini. He also owns shares in Mexican football club Necaxa as part of an ownership deal which includes other shareholders like actress Eva Longoria and model Kate Upton.\n\n### Controversies\n\nIn December 2016, as part of the release of the Football Leaks disclosure platform, it became known that the Spanish tax authorities had demanded back taxes of \u20ac2,017,152 from Mesut \u00d6zil. In addition, a fine of \u20ac789,963 was imposed on him. According to the information published by Football Leaks, \u00d6zil is said to have evaded taxes using offshore shell companies, Swiss accounts and straw men. In February 2017, \u00d6zil paid taxes in the required amount. He appealed the fine. At the beginning of 2018, the Spanish judiciary had not yet made a decision on the fine.\n\nIn July 2023 a photo on Instagram was published showing a tattoo with three crescent moons and a howling wolf on \u00d6zil's chest, which are symbols of Turkish far-right ultranationalist group Grey Wolves. This group is alleged to be responsible for acts of violence and threats and is banned in France and being monitored by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution due to anti-constitutional efforts.\n\nOn 13 October 2023, one week after the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and the subsequent bombing of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military, \u00d6zil expressed his regret over the deaths of thousands of people in Israel and the Gaza Strip and posted the slogan *Free Palestine* on X (formerly Twitter). After the Israeli airstrikes on Rafah in May 2024, he shared multiple Instagram story templates, including one on 31 May 2024 showing a map on which the word \"Israel\" has been crossed out and replaced with \"Palestine\" in handwriting. This was interpreted as a wish for a dissolution of the state of Israel. On 30 July 2024, \u00d6zil again published a post on Instagram showing a map on which the word \"Israel\" was crossed out and replaced with \"Palestine\".\n\nCareer
