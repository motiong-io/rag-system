Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. Identify the largest ward in Monaco, which is Monte-Carlo.
2. Determine the General Motors vehicle named after Monte-Carlo, which is the Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
3. Find the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which is 1970.
4. As of 1970, consider how many people had walked on the moon.

As of 1970, the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 had successfully landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin on the moon's surface. They were the first two people to walk on the moon. 

Later, in November 1969, the Apollo 12 mission also landed on the moon, with astronauts Pete Conrad and Alan Bean walking on the moon.

So, as of the first model year of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo (1970), a total of 4 people had walked on the moon: Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, Pete Conrad, and Alan Bean.
