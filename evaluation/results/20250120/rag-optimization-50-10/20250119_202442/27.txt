        What years did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played for Chelsea FC from 1945 to 1947.

What was the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947?:
The text does not explicitly state the numbering system used by Chelsea FC during the years 1945 to 1947. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Chelsea FC used a traditional numbering system during this period.

In the 1928 match at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea used a numbering system where players were assigned numbers based on their position on the field. This system was:

1. Goalkeeper
2. Right full back
3. Left full back
4. Right half back
5. Centre half back
6. Left half back
7. Outside right
8. Inside right
9. Centre forward
10. Inside left
11. Outside left

Although this system was used in 1928, it is likely that Chelsea FC continued to use a similar traditional numbering system during the years 1945 to 1947, as there is no mention of them adopting a different system during this period.

It's worth noting that the text does mention Tommy Lawton's squad number during his time at Chelsea (1945-1947), but it does not provide information on the specific numbering system used by the team during this period.

What position or role did Tommy Lawton play for Chelsea FC?:
Tommy Lawton played as a centre-forward for Chelsea FC.


        


Generated answer: Based on the traditional numbering system used by Chelsea FC, which assigned numbers based on positions on the field, Tommy Lawton would have likely worn the number 9 jersey. This is because he played as a centre-forward, and according to the numbering system mentioned, the centre-forward position was assigned the number 9.
