        obersevations:
        When was Princess Diana born?:
Princess Diana was born on July 1, 1961.

If Princess Diana had been born three years earlier, what would be her new birth year?:
If Princess Diana was born three years earlier, we need to subtract 3 from her original birth year. 

Princess Diana was born in 1961, so:

1961 - 3 = 1958

Her new birth year would be 1958.

Who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1968?:
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1968 was Harold Wilson.


        


Generated answer: If Princess Diana had been born three years earlier, her new birth year would be 1958. 

To find out who the Prime Minister was when she was 10 years old, we need to add 10 to her new birth year:

1958 + 10 = 1968

According to the information, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1968 was Harold Wilson. 

So, if Princess Diana had been born three years earlier, Harold Wilson would have been the Prime Minister when she was 10 years old.
