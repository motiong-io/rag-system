Generated answer: To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps.

First, we know that the oldest extant football team in Italy is Genoa Cricket and Football Club. This team plays in the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.

Next, we find out that the stadium is named after Luigi Ferraris, an Italian footballer, engineer, and soldier.

Now, we need to determine who the emperor of China was when Luigi Ferraris was 5 years old. To do this, we need to know Luigi Ferraris' birth year. Unfortunately, the provided observations do not explicitly state his birth year. However, based on external knowledge or further research (not provided in the observations), Luigi Ferraris was born in 1887.

When Luigi Ferraris was 5 years old (in 1892), the emperor of China was Guangxu Emperor. He was the ninth emperor of the Qing dynasty and reigned from 1875 to 1908.
