Generated answer: According to my knowledge, the Dewey Decimal Classification for the Charlotte Bronte book "Jane Eyre" published in 1847 is 823.8. 

If we assume that the height of the Bronte Tower is 823.8 feet, we can compare it to the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024.

As of my knowledge cutoff, some of the tallest buildings in New York City include:

1. One World Trade Center (1,776 feet)
2. Central Park Tower (1,550 feet)
3. 111 West 57th Street (1,428 feet)
4. One Vanderbilt (1,401 feet)
5. 432 Park Avenue (1,396 feet)

Comparing these heights to the Bronte Tower's height of 823.8 feet, it would not be among the top 10 or even top 20 tallest buildings in New York City.

To give you a better idea, as of my knowledge cutoff, there are over 200 buildings in New York City that exceed a height of 600 feet. The Bronte Tower would likely rank somewhere around #50-#70 among the tallest buildings in NYC.

Keep in mind that this ranking may change over time due to new construction and updates to existing buildings.
